@NurseNeeners Oh no.  So sorry to hear.   At least he's no longer suffering and you can reflect on the good times.
@THEMOOSE78 You too Jay :)
"@Engelstryker @Frugal_Streamer With the announcement of the 1650, you're looking at 1080p/60 streaming for about $175.  You's be hardpressed to find a CPU that will give you that performance while trying to run at x264 medium preset and a 4 max b-frame setting."
"@THEMOOSE78 I would think so, if that's all its doing."
"@Engelstryker @Frugal_Streamer Well yes, with a caveot:   if you have a PC that requires a mobo/CPU/RAM to upgrade and you're looking to buy a Turing based NVIDIA RTX 2060 and the upcoming GTX 1660/1650.  All give you x264 medium preset quality at &lt;$350 with almost now performance hit to the CPU."
@THEMOOSE78 It would still be significant.  I can't stream on my 1800x at 1080p/60 using x264 without serious FPS loss in games.
@Engelstryker @Frugal_Streamer It doesn't need much as far as pushing a displays goes.  It's the Turing NVENC encoder that adds the horsepower to encode your frames for your broadcast.
@Frugal_Streamer Looks like it will fall around $175.  Turing quality NVENC to get an aging PC added life giving it x264 medium preset quality at 1080p/60 plus its efficiency is next level.  Definitely a frugal recommended upgrade if it holds true.

"@dan_mitre There's so many issues with running big teams.  I never thought a game like BF would work the way it's designed with 64 players in a large scale league.  At most 8v8 or 10v10.  Plus, teams that big would be a nightmare to manage week to week."

I will start putting together my Turin NVENC test video tonight.  There's a lot of stuff to go over and compare.
Keep an eye out.  Logic says the 1660 could be $230-250 range and includes the better NVENC.  Not a bad upgrade to give you 1080p/60 streaming at x264ish quality.  https://t.co/yJHWA0wtlH

"@BillyEatWorld @ModestPelican @Losssyy @MrProWestie Billy's right though.  A good audio setup shouldn't need much of anything.  Most live setups have a compressor, EQ, and reverb, if you're singing.  That""s really it.  The video is really geared toward cheaper microphones."

@ATREES_92 @hadztv @MrProWestie Some people struggle with them.  P's are my mine.  Even with a pop filter they are sometimes harsh.
"@CagedProtocol @BillyEatWorld @MrProWestie Yeah, basically.  Reducing the gain on your mic a bit can help some."
@souljaboy @streamlabs @PlayApex You need to buy a pair a pants that fit.
"@CagedProtocol @BillyEatWorld @MrProWestie You do have some reflections causing reverb in your room.  If you can clean that up, it should sound pretty good."
"@CagedProtocol @BillyEatWorld @MrProWestie LOL,  nevermind, that was me, rip."
@TweakTown @Logitech Must have.....
"@CagedProtocol @BillyEatWorld @MrProWestie Sounds like somehow you're feeding your mic signal into OBS twice.  There's about a 5-10msec delay between them.  Could be sound reflections off of your wall, floor, etc, but I'd check option 1 first."

"@team_semperFi That's why I wanted to test it for myself.  I don't see huge leaps in quality, but that also may be due to the beta of OBS Studio."
"@team_semperFi With the new NVENC, there isn't much difference I can tell from the 1080 to the 2060.  Both look good IMO, but the 2060 is just a hair sharper."
"@team_semperFi Yep, and that's why I tested it with BFV because it'll bring any stream quality to its knees."
@team_semperFi Here:  https://t.co/wYVdeHUUKz
"@team_semperFi I didn't.  This was all just the gaming PC.  I think that's where the main selling point will be.  Also, I have a cut where I played and streamed just off of the RTX and FPS was still 85+ at 1080p/60 max: Hi fidelity"

Done what I could with the RTX NVENC recording/streaming.  Interesting results.  This cheater I was spectating was done at 6000 bitrate at 1080p/60 using the new OBS with NVENC improvements and max quality with keyframes at 2 and bframes at 2 max.  https://t.co/5ur0Dpdhus

"I’m reminded of something one of my lecturers once said that is simple and profound. 

“Grace is grace is grace.”

Yes the grace of God is active in every aspect of the Christian experience but it’s not different in each situation. It’s just grace. 

#theology"
"I’m really not a fan of the use of abjectives that modify “grace” in Christian theology; e.g. saving, sanctifying, glorifying, etc. As far as I can see these modifications are not something found in Scripture but have crept into theological discourse over time. 1/2"

@johnclifton_ @andymilleriii @callummckenna @samjtomlin @Dean_Pallant You see to be assuming the gospel is limited to conversion. It’s not. All life within the kingdom is part of the gospel.

"@WillSeattle @wsdot_traffic @seattletimes I will say again, I studied the snow routes and timetables ahead of time in order to make an informed decision as how to get downtown to my job. A bus was scheduled to come to my stop at 5:02am and never came. The next bus did not arrive for another 35 minutes. It was 20F."
"@wsdot_traffic @seattletimes I carefully studied the time tables and snow routes and the first southbound 62 bus never came. The Seattle buses do not cater to those who rely on them, shift and weekend workers who do not get paid enough to afford alternative transportation."
@kellatrixlstrng 45 minutes in the cold waiting for a bus that never came. When I called metro information the same bus was already ***magically*** downtown. I call bullshit. Caught the next bus after standing in -6C for almost an hour. I was supposed to open my coffee shop 13 minutes ago.
@Lukemcfed @briesulit This edit is so great it almost made me forget that “Mr. Blue Sky” is a negative pressure point for me.
I only slept an hour last night (tonight?) over anxiety for how I’d get to work. Just walked half a mile over ice to a bus stop for a bus I’m not actually sure is going to come. It’s 4:45am. Seattle doesn’t salt for ecological reasons but my hands are shaking.

@lunarruler Mental health system here is falling apart. I'm not asking for help now because they'll take therapy away. But I need to deal with my past if I've any hope of getting better.

@lunarruler Because the NHS says you have to be mentally stable to cope with therapy. Problem is I'll never get the stability if I don't get the therapy
@lunarruler I've only just got to the top of the waiting list for therapy. If they think I'm too unstable they'll stop it
@FUCKDEPRESSIO13 I don't want them to hospitalise me. I'm only just getting my therapy after months of waiting. They'll stop it if they think I'm too unstable
@lunarruler I'm trying to avoid going back to hospital
I just don't think I have the energy anymore
I'm in such a terribly dangerous place right now. It scares me so much being this low. I've self harmed really badly for the first time in ages but I still feel like I want to do more. I'm spiralling &amp; I don't know how to stop it 😭

@CUnderwoodUK I think the people who flaunt it are trying too hard to make things look rosy on the home front when really it's s**t. I've seen it so many times from couples I know are in trouble. They put on this big show for the rest of the world. Makes me laugh. It's sad really.
@CUnderwoodUK Me &amp; my wife show each other how much we love each other every day of the year. We feel no need to celebrate valentines day. We exchange cards &amp; that's it. Every day I have with her is special and we don't feel the need to prove or flaunt our relationship.
@BpdBryan Hmm well I started therapy last week so this should be easy for me to answer but it's hard. I guess not using a judgemental tone &amp; validating the person's feelings
@originalmuse1 The benefits of twitter far out way the bad for me personally. So much support and understanding here.
@cridibaruns @TheWalkingDead This is potentially very dangerous for you. I know it would be for me. Sleep is essential to help keep us sane. You should skip college and go to bed. Get some rest before you start to spiral.

"@AsvpMimz @JozlynPadilla @babyajules Fine. My initial reaction to this video is anger. I may be fine with it in a few months, but I'm still angry and disappointed. But hey, it's my initial reaction."
@AsvpMimz @JozlynPadilla @babyajules Sorry for expecting a man to try and support the woman carrying his child emotionally and expecting him to love the kid no matter what. He's a grown ass man. He can give a smile and try to interact in a healthy  supportive way while she literally risks her life to have his baby.
"@AsvpMimz @JozlynPadilla @babyajules Again, sucks that he has a bias against having a daughter for whatever reason. His behaviour is childish. That's what people don't like. His partner needs his support and he's acting stroppy because he isn't getting what he wants."
"@AsvpMimz @JozlynPadilla @babyajules Him not wanting a girl isn't what's bad. It sucks he couldn't just be like ""I don't care about the sex/gender"" but that's not the worst part.

It's that he acts like a stroppy child while his pregnant partner is struggling to hold the child they have bc they're having a girl."

@HandsTiedChloeX Story of my life lololol 😂
@HandsTiedChloeX Haha i got you
@HandsTiedChloeX Lmao 😂 I promised myself I wouldn’t buy anything for a while after I bought these. Don’t know how long that will last tho...
@HandsTiedChloeX Also I used a coupon code which gave me 5% off as well that I can give you if you decide you want them
@swiftiereads I LITERALLY SCREAMED WHEN I OPENED THE BOX AND SAW THEM
"@HandsTiedChloeX https://t.co/hqYkqKeTZu 
Here have a look. They said that they collect Harry Potter books and sell the existing ones they have when they find ones in a lower print number."
@HandsTiedChloeX The same seller has another set in relatively the same condition and it’s even a little cheaper. You should check it out
@HandsTiedChloeX I know I was like this when I saw the listing https://t.co/IwgTS103XT
@HandsTiedChloeX These were worth $200 INCLUDING international shipping from the UK on eBay. The books themselves were $120 so I SNATCHED them up so quick
@HandsTiedChloeX Also they were relatively a good price. I talked to an Australian seller who wanted to charge $300 for a whole set that had really faded spines and really yellowing pages and I was like um no thank you. Ones in that condition are not worth that much ya lunatic
@HandsTiedChloeX I know. I contemplated buying them for a few weeks but I figured it’s an investment. The value of them increases as time goes on so if I ever (god forbid) decide to re sell them someday they would be worth way more than what I paid for them originally ya know??
@HandsTiedChloeX Yeah they were also expensive...

"Throw the entire @NAB board in jail! Gosh, their name suits them! They nab everything they think they can get away with. Bunch of crooks! #BankingRoyalCommission"
"This Adrian shouldn’t be commended. He had no concern for my welfare. Had he, he would have done something to help. No, instead he saw me mentioning the “s-word” as a “get out of jail free card”, a means of getting me off the phone line so he could go back to not helping people."
.@blackdoginst @beyondblue #VictorianPolice #BankingRoyalCommission @NAB #MoreThanMoney - please see this ranty thread.
"So no support there. My work suffered, and then they fired me. Discarded me. A loyal employee who had only had two other jobs, the shortest of which was 10 years. So much for NAB supporting mental health issues! It’d be hilarious if it weren’t so tragic, so many people suffering"
"The NAB (MLC is part of NAB) fired me...I was pleading for my job. I had five team leaders in 14 months. I told all of them I was being treated for anxiety and depression. The team leader I had the longest said, “you need to see your GP for ways of leaving your problems at home.”"
...and I have been suicidal IN THE PAST. I told the police that call will have been recorded and I hope they fine Adrian and NAB for wasting police time and resources.
"Now the police have turned up on my doorstep saying Adrian called them as I had threatened suicide, which I DID NOT DO. I merely told him he should be considering it an emergency as I am a disability pensioner, I’m being treated for anxiety and depression..."
"...He then had the gall to say it’s because of the Royal Commission’s findings that he is not helping me as he is showing he’s abiding by guidelines. I’m stunned, saddened, angry, confused, appalled, and many more adjectives. In the end he got what he wanted - I hung up."
"...the findings of the Banking Royal Commission were, and how dishonest banks have been proven to be - evidenced by their CEO resigning! - but all banks are the same and we are forced to put our money somewhere! You’d think they’d be trying to help people, to rectify their image."
"...and have previously been suicidal, should be “emergency” enough! The absolutely gall, the rudeness, of him making a judgement on what I spend MY MONEY on! I asked to speak to HIS supervisor and he told me he’s the most senior person in the office! I then said how appalling..."
"...and doesn’t justify the granting of a temporary overdraft, as it is hardly an emergency. I told him it’s my money, he has NO BUSINESS asking me what I am going to spend it on, and the fact I am a disability pensioner, being treated for anxiety and depression..."
"... Raphael mentioned a temporary overdraft could tide me over until the reversal comes through, but Adrian is refusing to do this. I said I’m going to dinner tonight and need to pay a gardener to weed my garden on Monday. He said that is not an emergency...!"
"...you’d think they’d want to help people to try to rectify their image! Clearly they STILL DO NOT CARE and their customers are not people, not human beings, just a means to rort profits."
...this is a @Visa #DebitCard so it is MY OWN MONEY they are refusing to give me access to! I declared bankruptcy so have no access to credit at all. I’m surprised I’m offered so little help after the #BankingRoyalCommission so rightly blackened @nab’s name!...
"...Adrian can see the reversal is coming! Previous customer service officer, Raphael, advised if @abebooks email them they can give me a temporary overdraft until authority drops off. Why isn’t my correspondence from ABE and the fact they can see the reversal coming enough?..."
...he can see reversal is coming through but will take a few more business days. In the meantime I have nothing to live on! He refuses to accept me forwarding @abebooks buyertechs emails from me. ABE have no phone contact and take 24hrs to reply to emails! Adrian can see...
"Absolutely appalling service from the supervisor, Adrian, in the @nab call centre who refuses to give me access to my own money. @AbeBooks took an authority on my card on 1/4 and I have emails from them saying transaction cancelled and reversal sent. Adrian can even see this!..."

"@candaceshaw @khaleesi_101 @PhelpsieSarah I’m not so sure they know they’re lying. If that’s true, how is it they are so convincing? Having a belief the lies were true could explain that."
@khaleesi_101 @candaceshaw @PhelpsieSarah So you are happy to flout the law because you know they won’t sue? I think I’m glad I don’t live in your world.
@khaleesi_101 @candaceshaw @PhelpsieSarah The article falls short of stating categorically he did that. You do not. Innocent until proven guilty. Your tweet is libellous.
@JoanEllis777 @PhelpsieSarah Haha!! No. Mine is incorrectly framed square so has no crucifix. Sad.
@JoanEllis777 @PhelpsieSarah Ah. I’m on the wrong side then! Perhaps I should have the image reversed for the position it’s in?
"@khaleesi_101 @candaceshaw @PhelpsieSarah No, In fact I think the opposite is true, though I’m in no position to judge really. But I always try to put myself in other people’s shoes."
"@JoanEllis777 @PhelpsieSarah My right hand, or the painting’s?"

@AmandaCWriter I’m astounded by your lack of compassion. Don’t forget scrapping the film will affect many more people than just the book’s author.
@khaleesi_101 @PhelpsieSarah But much of that is the system. Don’t forget money doesn’t buy happiness - or mental health. I have known narcissistic manipulators too. I empathise - at a distance. I cannot make my mind up on whether they know they’re lying to get what they want or if they believe their lies.
"@j_mcconnachie I had the same reaction, James. The article greatly saddened me. The response on twitter has been horrible. One person even stated they hoped the film gets cancelled. So much bile and spite against someone who (I feel) needs help."
"@stuartbache @minchinwrites @SarahRPainter @bluebanana20 You are an astounding artist, Stuart!"
"@PhelpsieSarah I think the article is terrible. Regardless of whether the article is true, where is the empathy? He clearly needs help, and was there any thought given for the consequences? The twitter response is terrible. One person said they hope it leads to the film being cancelled."

Think this is the first time in my whole life that I didn’t watch the super bowl
They want my spot and don’t deserve it.. can’t forget that.
Had a dream I went grocery shopping now I wanna go to the store

I love how people be like “I’m here if you wanna talk” and don’t text me back 🙃
I need help but idk how to get it
Sometimes I wish I didn’t talk
Most people can’t relate but I really don’t be worried about other people

Injecting a bit of self confidence 😀 https://t.co/TywW0RV7sD
The amount of hate still on Henderson’s instagrams account is unreal. 1) he didn’t play 2) we were shite 3) it took us till 90+4 to get a decent shot on target
"Make Origi our highest paid player now, fuck it give him the captains armband too"
What a bloody thriller!!!
What was you all saying about Origi ????
Not been one player today that’s looked arsed about winning
This has to be the most boring derby I’ve ever watched
Nice to see a lines woman doing a great job!

"@IgorSalamanLFC I’m talking about myself lol don’t worry, I’m always quick to complain 😂"

@IgorSalamanLFC Exactly!! Yet there’s me here sat complaining 😂

@jayz20_lfc You have to be a leader and commander in that position
"@chrick81 He’s a brilliant player but he’s managed to stabilise a back line consistently, that’s it..."
Just because VVD is arguably the best defender we’ve had in years doesn’t exactly justify him being captain... #UnpopularOpinion
Seen the runts of the litter piping up putting shit on our players social media 🙄
@Manso97_ Yeah 😂😂
He’s the only one that won’t try and make a mountain out of a mole hill when trying to score... just fucking shoot!!!
"Sturridge has been so crucial in so many of our games this season and last, big big dark horse!"
When will Klopp realise that starting DS is not a crime

Baby’s due date tomorrow 😳
@wh_lfc Thank youuuuu
@Ms83Mark Hahah it’s fine thanks though
@Ms83Mark Do Tesco? I’m craving them 😫
Which super market sells Cheetos ?
Why make a tweet wishing horrendous injury on a player and then backtracking calling it “a joke” when you get called out
@IgorSalamanLFC Can’t wait for it lol I’ll be on cloud nine
@IgorSalamanLFC Hahah yes I’m all ready
@IgorSalamanLFC Hahah I’m due on Friday so we’ll see!
@michaelcarter73 Yeah not like we nearly won the league with them 😊😊😊😊
@IgorSalamanLFC I think I’ll deactivate
@TinkMaudes Ahhh thanks Tink😘
@IgorSalamanLFC Hahah they’ll all be licking their arses come Saturday
@CousinCAH He’s had a good game though shouldn’t be getting half the stick he should be
"@IgorSalamanLFC True, shouldn’t expect nothing less"
Love how there’s a full defence in front of SM that can’t do their job yet he still gets the shit from fans 😂
"Tonight’s game is the blame game! Henderson, Mignolet, Moreno... the list goes on!"
"@Jay_Star1892 Ya win some ya lose some that’s football, and if you aren’t playing to you’re best you get your comeuppance"
@Ben24DH I can stay awake a bit longer now 😂
@Seun_000 He slipped
"@Jay_Star1892 First game in months and months, he’s pulled off some pretty decent saves and I think he’s showed klopp how good he is"
@kop_girl77 Don’t know why they call themselves fans half the time!
"@kop_girl77 Exactly, he’s been great all game, credit where it’s due to Hazard he’s brilliant"
Oh wait just seen my first mignolet criticism tweet 🙄🙄🙄
"Feel like the worlds gonna end first game we’ve lost, just want premier league back x"
@Ben24DH I’m laid in bed so technically could just slowly drift off 😂
@Ben24DH Oh heck I’m off to bed soon that can’t stand pens me 😂
"@Ben24DH Off topic, does this game go to pens?"
Fuck sake!!! First brilliant save by mignolet though
@syelaw Check my retweet
Appears that everyone’s opinion on Hendo has dramatically changed 🤥
See you all in 45 minutes 😬
@MrBeerMonkey I agree although I think mane has a little edge on Sturridge this game
@SophieRose1_x Yeah exactly or even Gomez??? Mignolet has looked steady too
"I’d like to see Hendo in this midfield, Milner has had to press too much leaving big gaps"
@SophieRose1_x Yeah everyone’s really just come to life in the last ten minutes
@andymay68 He’s been quite poor for me
Shaqiri best player
@Oageng_Mpipi No excuse they’ve all been training together
@craigythered Can never be too careful only takes a second
@philnealfanclub Maybe but very dangerous!
Liverpool playing like they’re trying to win their ball back off the year 11’s 🙄
@craigythered Very very risky business
Why is Barkley playing while chewing gum????
"@Jay_Star1892 IOS, wants me to sign up for shit"
@Jay_Star1892 Yep not working
@CousinCAH I’ll try it

I’ll prolly only get like 20 likes on Facebook when I announce my child’s birth lol
@Manso97_ I remember feeling like that when we had Roy in charge
@Manso97_ No he doesn’t
@MadAsAfwog Thanks Adam I’m just getting very apprehensive and feeling everything under the sun! X
"@BenWebbLFC Thank you I’m sure it is just one of those days, especially as baby is nearly here"
@JayGoreLFC But more importantly it’s my due date 😂
@JayGoreLFC Friday!!!
@Jay_Star1892 There are 10 other players on the pitch capable of doing their job 😂😂
@Jay_Star1892 And it’s good that we can actually rotate with a good enough squad! Which some people can’t seem to realise 😂
"@Jay_Star1892 Yeah klopp said that’s the only player he’s confirming, he is a hard worker"
Actually really glad mignolet is starting tomorrow night
"@Khloee___ I knowwwww, I just want the nice husband now too"
"@Khloee___ Hahah, wish I was 18 again tbf x"
"@Khloee___ You’re right they don’t, but sometimes it’s a risk worth taking x"
@Khloee___ Reach out girl! Ya never know 🤷‍♀️
@Khloee___ Yes yes yes! Feeling this
@ANFIELD_JIMMY Oooh soz

"@Ben24DH God I know, bet they will leave it open though they always do 🙄"
@CieranSmyth I hope not
@CieranSmyth 5 days
Really need to sort me mood out
@KirstyLFC1892 👀 this has brightened up my day
Hope the person taken ill at Barnsley game makes a full recovery ❤️
It’s our year guys
Ohhh Matip Matip!
Knew he’d start Shaq❤️
@mactoots 😫😫😫
Is there ever such thing as a favourite relationship because I wanna rewind a year lol
@The7uffster @BelloLfc1801 If Leeds don’t get promoted he’ll go back there I think
@PyeWhite It will. You can see how much he enjoys playing
@PyeWhite He will undoubtedly although I’ve got a niggly feeling next season might be his last 👀
I thought Milner had signed a contract till 2022?
@Khloee___ We’ve still got a good enough squad either way
"@Jay_Star1892 It’s not the end of the world if a player doesn’t start, just shows we have enough quality to pull from the bench"
Why do people get right up on their high horse at any mention of squad rotation lol. Start Shaq tomorrow I say 🤷‍♀️
"Unpopular opinion but Patrice Evra is infectious, such a cool guy hahah"
@Khloee___ I am! I just want him here now
@Khloee___ I think you’re probably right! A lot of people say they have a clear out hahah xx
Love getting a bug a week before giving birth 🙃

"@tommo_80 Hahah oh dear. Am gonna keep it a secret, mainly because I’m still really undecided 😂"
"@tommo_80 I’m really excited but calm too! I’m having a little boy, another little red!"
@tommo_80 Oh like you’d know 😉😂
Omg the baby countdown is in single figures 😫😫😫
@D_Name Yes thank you
@RedWayYNWA_ He didn’t really look angry but more of just an “ugh” moment 😂
@RedWayYNWA_ He’s probably frustrated because he knew he could’ve done better I wouldn’t have taken it as an insult to bobby
Mbappé may be fast but Andy Robertson will always be faster
@MadAsAfwog Reverse psychology;)
@MadAsAfwog Always do it the hard way 😂😂😂
Should’ve put a bet on a fucking said it was gonna be 2-2
@Jay_Star1892 Yep doesn’t work
@D_Name They don’t work on my iPhone
All my streams are really behind some one link me up please!!!!
@MadAsAfwog I’ve got a stream Adam now thanks even if it is behind! X
Oh god I’m so excited!!!!!
Any good LFC streams?
Also just watched another video from after the UCL final of Hendo crying and I’m now a broken woman
Hope we don’t go giving away silly fouls tonight we all know what neymar is capable of too...
Ever remember Steven caulker 💔
Wanting someone you can’t have is literally heart breaking
@JackH96_ Know where I am if u ever need out
Apparently my unborn baby is a fan of daddy Yankee
@JackH96_ :-(
@Alan_Dawson1971 Yeah
@Alan_Dawson1971 Just missing someone
Feel so down 😪
Mad how things can change so quickly within a year
"Dermot O’Leary with a baby, melts my heart ❤️"
Makes me laugh how I’m due in 13 days an people just sit there looking at you... move bitch!!!
That was so Henderson’s fault 🙄
Hahahah get in Gini
Need to start Shaq second half
Not used to seeing this minute on the clock and it being 0-0
@MadAsAfwog You definitely are xx
Some people are sooooo toxic but sometimes it’s almost laughable
"@bemama_UK Definitely! And now only 14 days until my due date, hoping little man makes his appearance very soon!"
@LFClass92 I would! Let’s just hope he’s not this active on a night when he’s born 😂
"@LFClass92 Aw! Yep I’m feeling it now, he’s super active tonight which doesn’t help either 😫"

@Lauren24LFC I’ll be terrified all the time 😂
@Lauren24LFC And it’ll be 10x the worry when he’s here 😂
@Lauren24LFC Exactly! Just making me worried for no reason
@Lauren24LFC Yep! Just annoyed with the midwives feel a bit let down my anxiety is through the roof 😔
@Lauren24LFC Baby was measuring too small so got sent for a scan now he’s measuring too big!
One thing after another with this baby 😫

"@Jay_Star1892 I’m not slating him, I just think it’s pointless when a goalkeeper tries to do things like that as 10/10 it fails"
"I’m not mad we conceded I’m more mad with the manner we conceded in, will haunt me that 🙄"
Oh well we got 3 points!
@CousinCAH You know how much I love him 😂
"Give it a rest with the Hendo bashing, it’s an ugly game but there’s other players on the pitch not putting their best efforts in"
@alexjwedwards Knew it was gonna happen at some point 😂😂
I’m only gonna say it this once... get Karius back!!!!
The moan brigade is well and truly out😂 for the first season in years we’ve got a calm and strong goalkeeper oh and we’re winning 1-0!!!
@tmoraitauthor With you on that one😁
"@Ste_Haw You’re probably right, even last game he just looked disinterested"
What is going on with Salah?
Bloody slab head in way all time

@ira sometimes people screw up their own lives
Just because you don’t see any bears don’t mean there aren’t any around
Why is it always the man at fault in a divorce
"What happens in Washington and Hollywood really does not matter, what does matter is what’s happening in your town or neighborhood"
Ever notice how out of the blue your rent goes up
I refuse to vote ever again
@mishacollins no
Many actors are told what to say by liberal demagoguery
@AOC listen to Whoopi girl you are not seasoned enough to pontificate
@mishacollins well that is a reason to never watch Supernatural again
"Don’t pray for a new car but pray for your neighbors, don’t pray to be rich pray for your family"
I pray not to check it off my list of things to do but because I need to
"The books I read are by spurgeon, chambers graham and the bible"
"I don’t go to movies anymore and I don’t watch much television, so many actors are so foul-mouthed and filled with irrational hate"
Hollywood actors are non thinkers
@greggutfeld will the President resign eight months from now to keep his family and his self from being arrested and prosecuted
My America is dead
The last few years have made me never want to vote again
My sister says the President will resign in eight months on the condition none of his family or he goes to prison
God is not on the republicans side or the democrats side He is for the faithful
God may help you get what you need not necessarily what you want
God is not a genie who will grant your wish for a new Cadillac or make you financially rich
"Those that attack you for something in your past are guilty of judging when they are not qualified to do so, only God is and he has forgiven and forgotten"
@PauleyP California is broke and the new governor is welcoming people who can not speak English and who have new job skills into the state. Expect your state taxes to double
Ulcerative colitis is a pain
Never watch network news it causes insanity
"Democrats say the President is a liar, but from experience all senators and congressmen In Washington are liars too they are only there to get rich and powerful"
Jesus cancels anxiety. -Matthew 6:25
I wish people would thank God at award ceremonies
Ulcerative colitis is the thorn in my side that I have to live with
@LNW4Trump I thought most in Hollywood were atheist
When you have ulcerative colitis you are always exhausted and to get anything done is mind over matter
Ulcerative colitis not only hits your digestive system it also gives you arthritis and less than ideal skin
When you have ulcerative colitis the list of food you can eat is shorter than the list you can
@PauleyP I guess citizens of the twitterverse want you to be in a relationship and be as miserable as they are
Those who resort to physical threats have already lost the discussion/debate
I am feeling cruddy so I am not in the best mood. I may start repeating dialogue from slingblade
"If America was more like Venezuela we would not have problems with illegal immigration, we would lose Americans though"
I am to the point where I would allow anyone into the country and let martial law be imposed.
Washington and Hollywood are full of Pharisee and Sadducee along with many false prophets
"Politicians constantly put their foot in their mouth, you would think they would learn"
The thing about the shutdown is we can see what we can do without in our government
"Being a Christian is the most radical thing you can be, it means the things of this world mean nothing to you"
Ulcerative colitis takes your energy and leaves you exhausted all the time
"My ulcerative colitis decided to act out, it’s no bueno"
You matter to God
People matter to God
I do not expect much from the government because it is full of humans
@DanaDelany People should be more vigilant
The things that happen in Washington and Hollywood are of no concern to me
"The book I prefer reading is the Bible, the activity I need is pray , my faith fuels my actions hopefully more than this world"
We need to have recall votes on every senator and congressmen
People don’t think before they tweet
Someone made terroristic threats on twitter against a republican senator- do they realize that is not covered under freedom of speech
@PauleyP I have bed head worse than that I am a champion bed head
If you tax the rich by 70% they will close their factories and fire their employees and so 80% will be unemployed
The percentage of good to evil in Washington is 80% evil and 20% good and as to who is good and who is evil time will tell
I prefer to pray for those that condemn me then to hate them
The book I prefer to read. . . the Bible

"@PauleyP Morning , are you keeping your New Years resolution"
"@PauleyP I gave up chocolate and loaded baked potatoes and desert in my New Years resolution also I declared I would take my medicine, work out and play golf"
"@MollyQuinn93 Yes, but I had reached a point I could not stand the mess any longer."
Politicians say outrageous things to get noticed
A cough drop that looks like a lollipop is less of a choking hazard
"Tax the rich ,increase prices and people will be unemployed and people will have to choose between food and medicine"
Ever notice how some politicians have diarrhea of the mouth and stunted mental acuity
Ever notice how people get sick after Christmas and New Years
@PauleyP you might need to put bars on your windows and carry a gun for protection as will most everyone in California
Liberal Democrats do not seem to care about the drugs and gangs that are entering the country their focus is on gaining  power and getting richer
"So far I have been adhering to my New Years resolution, even though my U.C. Has been raging and I may have a stomach virus"
Apparently the best way to lose weight is a stomach virus
People that believe in open borders shoul leave the doors and windows of their homes wide open
@PauleyP I find the less national news I a privy to the better off I am
News networks cause mental illness and perhaps gas
Some reporters think they can make the President answer their questions LOL
Twitter was weird for a minute
what happened to my keyboard
I feel like crud after I eat
@PauleyP I told Justin that tattoos on the face is a bad idea
Chocolate is also bad for people with u.c.
I got a big reminder last night why people with ulcerative colitis should not eat popcorn.
@BrianDietzen people are tired of politics and conflict and just don’t want to hear it☕️🛐✝️
Avoid popcorn if you have ulcerative colitis

"@PauleyP don’t tell anyone on social media you are leaving your home, because burglars monitor to know when to hit homes"
People are tired of politics and this constant back and forth.
@PauleyP what I would look like if I was a cartoon dog https://t.co/wtsPij2W18

If sharing your Christian Faith is hate speech and will get you banned from social media then we are no longer in a free country
My serious resolution is to pray more and study my bible more and leave the television off✝️

@JenniWhite0108 He’s not gonna see his grandchild either. I done favours for his louse arse yet I asked him to do one for me and he went on like a spoiled brat wanting it his way. I’ve been wearing specs since January of last year with the intention of learning to drive
@JenniWhite0108 I only refer to him as dickhead
"@JenniWhite0108 Nah, I’ve already said that I wouldn’t use it as a middle name. It feels disrespectful to papa"
@JenniWhite0108 We’re having a boy. God knows how many clothes he already has. We’ve been picking stuff up constantly in the sales if we see it
"@JenniWhite0108 If I had came home that day and found her, it would have ended me"
@JenniWhite0108 Who do you think would have found her
"@JenniWhite0108 God yes. It still lingers in my mind what couldn’t have happened. If had known any different that Saturday Val had phoned I would have left work straight away but as I said to Val on the phone, I thought it was stress from work"
@JenniWhite0108 Its something you don’t talk about. It’s the hardest thing I’ve had to go through and to see the devastation on Leanne’s face hearing the news
"@JenniWhite0108 @meres_laura Also you wanted to sort things. Anytime I came down the stairs, someone constantly shut the door"
"@JenniWhite0108 I didn’t come home that day when Val phoned because I had no fucking clue what was happening, I knew mum was stressed but I didn’t think it was like that. The reason I didn’t tell you about us expecting is because I felt no need to tell you"
@JenniWhite0108 @meres_laura I felt unwelcome in mums house during that period because of you. The only time mum spoke to me was when you fucked off out. Yeah I told mum through Facebook after the second pregnancy. We did that with everyone.
"@JenniWhite0108 @meres_laura I’ve done worse things to mum, like?"
@JenniWhite0108 @meres_laura Just having a laugh at the bull shit that constantly spews from your mouth

@AidenHatfield Good Morning!!
@AidenHatfield No one deserves this. Unfortunately people are quick to jump to bullying and name calling behind a screen. It still hurts the same as when you are face to face. Your doing a awesome job @AidenHatfield. Keep up the great work helping others through your music and voice.
@ElkaBr Girl! I tell you this one is hard. I’m trying everyday. Thank you for reminding me 😊 we are our own worst enemy.
@LPpiveral @AMillionABC Noooooo it can’t be.
@purplerecovery That is awesome! You rock!!! Congratulations 🎉

"@SuicidalWithBPD Off the adhd meds for almost 6 weeks to clear it out of my system. I hate feeling this way again. But, I know now that the meds will work just finding the right one is going to be the hard part. I hope my story helps you or someone out there. . I hope your day is good today."
"@SuicidalWithBPD then they started me on adhd meds and I couldn't believe how I felt just amazing like this thing I had been missing a puzzle piece if you will. But, that started to create panic attacks for me, they were a result of the meds I was on. Now I have been (see next post)"
"@SuicidalWithBPD I have been there and now there again. I was diagnosed with severe depression, partial remission ptsd, and adhd. I have been on depression meds for a while now we finally got my dose right. Then they started me on adhd meds. Oh my gosh I felt so (see next post)"

@memberguest It was great!!! Next time for sure
@memberguest alright it was awesome chatting with you! Have a great day! Headed to sell some houses. :)
@memberguest Well I can play the recorder if you need a musical guest at any time
@memberguest you need to do golf cart racing on one episode. That would be funny
@memberguest @marshmellomusic
"@memberguest Boring as hell! I was super disappointed, there was nothing about super the puppy bowl was more interesting"
@memberguest do you have a theme song you play right before you play a tournament?
@memberguest or in my case cart driving
@memberguest You should come up with some cool socks to wear golfing
@memberguest have you ever thought of doing a traveling member guest show? Lots of breweries in Virginia Beach &amp; Norfolk.
@memberguest Thanks for giving me a laugh! :) I think it needs to be a daily show honestly
@memberguest Of course I like of the music ones. I need to learn golf it would be nice but I sucked at PUTT PUTT so hitting the ball into a little hole further away might make me hit the drink cart up a little too much! I bowl better when I've been drinking. Golf?
@memberguest I loved the one @mikeshinoda was on
"@memberguest Do you ever allow fans to watch a taping of member 
guest?"
@memberguest Virginia Beach is 60 today and partly cloudy. Hows your weather?
@memberguest do you have any golf tournaments coming up?
@memberguest I can't wait! @memberguest makes me crack up! I've been at traffic lights and people stare. I've even snorted I've laughed so much lol

@IDeclareClaire I know I have done that too and it makes it sound bad. Then I just had something that wasn't even that. I would be dying everyday according to web md. lol
@SuicidalWithBPD That's not true you are someone to everyone here. We all have our good days and our bad days and our weeks that suck but I promise it's not too late to get help or talk to someone. Start a journal.
"@AidenHatfield Sweet dreams

@grandson That I’m here that even though today is a bad day not every day is like this. I’m thankful I got help and am in a better place than I was this time last year. I’m thankful I learned to take one day at a time and not hide my feeling but talk to someone. ❤️
@ThisIsROCK2019 Salmon patties the way my mom made then and stuffed bell peppers were not a favorite and I refuse to fix them as an adult

“I love you but I just don’t wanna see you for a month” is my current mood lol
"@cosmicindigo_ They should be able to tell you! if you call the therapist ahead of time and give ur insurance info they should tell you the copay. 
Every therapist I’ve had was a copay of $30-40. But everyone’s insurance is different obviously."
I need a therapist that’s not afraid to put me in my place lol
@cosmicindigo_ And ask** if she/he takes ur insurance
@cosmicindigo_ Ur insurance covers it! Just have to find one in ur network. Sometimes you can call the therapist &amp; if she takes ur insurance or you can call ur insurance for a list of in network therapists. There’s usually always a copy unless you have like Medicare.

Tell me ur stories/reviews of the copper IUD good or bad

Cuddling with Ezra for nap time today. Usually I let him cry it out in his room (he only cries for a minute and knocks out &amp; he’s 2 not 3 months so don’t judge me) but I just don’t want to see him upset anymore. He’s been so unhappy lately. 😭
An actual pic of me https://t.co/fTiemL6YxD
Forcing Ezra to drink some chamomile/lavender/peppermint tea and he’s not sure he likes it but he’s drinking it only bc I put it in my cup so he thinks it’s mine

"@realDonaldTrump @POTUS How's it feel to know that because of you, your children will be going to prison? To know that for the rest of history the Trump name will be synonymous with traitor &amp; your grandchildren will be ashamed to have your name? To know what you did &amp; what's coming? You will be exposed!"

"@billmaher As long as there's 2 parties controlling the government, you can never blame only 1. I am a life long anti-republican &amp; while I agree they are mainly the ones causing the destruction, the Democrats are like the nosy neighbors who hear all the abuse but never want to get involved."
@ProudResister You do realize that you just went on social media and actually spelled out the names of all the people you say other people are giving undeserved attention to on social media right?
@DrLindseyFitz @joerogan Well In the 21st century there's a world where 95% of the wealth belongs to 5% of the people. Where the rich openly allow children to starve to death in the streets. Where the rich are knowingly polluting the environment to its inevitable destruction. We're still barbaric!
@Gold_Rush I might to say conform by the way. Lol
"@Oreo You guys just totally missed the point of your cookie &amp; what people like about it. The concept is great, but the design is unattractive &amp; not associative at all to the Oreo brand. For some reason you guys refuse to make, what I thought to be obvious, the correct Oreo candy bar."
@Lawrence Did he want you to give that to Chris Matthews?
@MSNBC @KellyannePolls felt threatened enough to call 911 after a woman shook her by the arms. I wonder if the mothers at the border felt threatened when they had their arms ripped apart &amp; their children kidnapped by a policy  @KellyannePolls claims to be proud to support? #nosympathy4u
"@RealTimers @billmaher @GovChristie @JackKingston @NatashaBertrand @MalcolmNance @EricIdle @HBO @JackKingston you bragged that because of Trump Hispanic unemployment is at an historical all time low. Well just you know, it's not because he's some financial or business genius. It's because he deported them all."
"@RealTimers @billmaher @GovChristie @JackKingston @NatashaBertrand @MalcolmNance @EricIdle @HBO @ChrisChristie that's like saying ""Look, I don't agree with everything Hitler did. The whole world invasion &amp; holocaust thing wasn't cool, but by doing that he was able to boost the economy, so I support him for that"". You support a greedy racist, you are a greedy racist. PERIOD!"
"@Gold_Rush You took old footage that we already saw, recycled it to confirm to a fake title that you invented &amp; aired it as a new episode on a night we all tuned into expecting to see new footage. Then you have the nerve to call it a Special &amp; all to get free ad money. You lost a viewer!"
@MSNBC If you're a multi-millionaire &amp; you choose to keep the last name of Pecker then you're an ass.
@TerryJohnnyand @TheBeatWithAri @neal_katyal Are you joking? You are comparing this to racism? We see through you!
"@TheBeatWithAri @MSNBC @neal_katyal Yo Roger Stone, millions of Jewish people were torn from their homes &amp; drug to concentration camps to be murdered. The ones that got away &amp; hid in fear were hunted down mercilessly like dogs by the Gestapo &amp; murdered. You should be ashamed to compare that to what happened to you!"
"@TheBeatWithAri Roger stone, millions of Jewish people were torn from their homes &amp; drug to concentration camps to be murdered. The ones that got away &amp; hid in fear were hunted down mercilessly like dogs by the Gestapo &amp; murdered. How dare you compare that to what happened to you"
"@joerogan @Timcast Well how appropriate since I just got schooled on censorship by Twitter. You see after reading approved tweets about pigs eating humans, people being tortured &amp; genital mutilation, I was told my account was being penalized for saying f*ck Trump! The man who kidnapped children!?!?"
I just got told by Twitter that i can't voice my opinion about the traitor trump and the republican party onTwitter because of my language while looking at a posted story about porn and pigs eating humans. #Twittercantsilenceme
@MSNBC Omg. We investigate crimes not people? People commit crimes you idiots. How can you investigate a crime committed by a person but not the person himself? Thousa is getting ridiculous and stupid. #fucktrump
@Amerika49220449 @MSNBC The fact that you have Putin as your pic says all i need to say about that
@Amerika49220449 @MSNBC That's a lie
@MSNBC Omg. CNN rais they were camped out at Roger Stones house for months knowing this was coming. Hell i knew this was coming. That's ridiculous
"@MSNBC Mr. Whitaker you were appointed acting AG by a private citizen who won a scam election &amp; will inevitably be impeached &amp; possibly imprisoned. You may think you have power on your side, but it is fleeting. I promise you that smug look will be wiped off your face very soon"
@joerogan Their James Bond pigs. They like their food shaking &amp; not stirred. What? Too soon?
@EmmaWatson @_IntegrateUK That can't really be the name for it can it? It's really called Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation Day? That sounds so archaic. Damn! What our woman go thru to need a National Day consisting of those words.
I just mixed Southern Comfort with apple juice &amp; I swear it's like they were meant to go together.
"@VP @NASA My condolences to the families, but fuck you Pence! You religious racist nut"
@realDonaldTrump how's it feel to know that you &amp; your children will go down in history as racist traitors?  To know that as a father you put your children in prison? To know that your grandchildren will have to publicly ridicule &amp; denounce you to have any chance of a good life?
@miguel1025 @TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber @lizzwinstead Are you stupid? Lmao. People just don't get the politically correct atmosphere we've cornered ourselves into do they? You say such a stupid thing in public.
"@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber @lizzwinstead I guess i don't get fashion, because that dude looks like a beanbag chair!"
@AriMelber yo that fashion icon you just had on looked like a bean bag chair man. I guess I don't get fashion
@AriMelber If Charles Manson made a point would you help him with his defense to help set him free? This man is one of the worst type of arrogant criminals out there &amp; you are the last person I thought would be spreading information to help this man with his defense. Not cool @AriMelber!
@masa3256 @Lawrence You feel better?
@steve_sherwood @Lawrence @latimes Like that matters you idiot
@NBCNews @Morning_Joe @realDonaldTrump how does it feel to see your world caving in around you &amp; to know that your greed &amp; arrogance put your own children in prison? To know that for the rest of history the name Trump will be synonymous with traitor &amp; your grandchildren will always be ashamed of you?

"@MSNBC Everyday for years this man &amp; his conspiracy theory ""friends"" went on every media device demanding President Obama be investigated for everything down to his birth certificate &amp; now he wants to claim that he's the victim of presidential harassment. I can't wait till he's arrested"
"@LouisCKlive I've been fighting political correctness ever since I discovered it &amp; I admit there's a thin line between that &amp; ignorance, but that's not your story. You see you're just an insensitive prick who just happens to be funny. Comedy should heal but you use it as a weapon"
It seems you either have to be extremely politically correct or a scumbag criminal in Washington these days. Can't we just have someone normal who isn't afraid to break political norms without committing multiple felonies &amp; just being a douchebag? We need new everything
Stacey Abrams last night in front of that green screen making it look like people were standing behind her was almost enough to make me vomit. Everything just seems so fake &amp; artificial anymore &amp; I don't know why we're pushing ourselves down this path because it won't end well.
"Will someone please make another media service like YouTube that's less greedy? I just had to watch 16 ads to see one video! 16 FREAKING ADS for 1 single video. They are greedy &amp; out of hand &amp; need to go the way of Myspace. If someone makes another YouTube with less ads, they win"
To not be blind &amp; see the world as it truly is can weaken you. Guilt replaces joy &amp; wealth only determines happiness if you're poor. Love last as long as patience &amp; in the digital age we have none. The future always looks bleak as we reminisce about the past &amp; pain is tolerable.
"@joerogan I'm surprised to hear you celebrating this fishy story. I get that it needed to be done but geez @joerogan, you didn't have to call it a cunt. Lol. Besides, it takes a full 5-8 minutes to suffocate something to death &amp; I don't believe he actually choked a mountain lion that long!"
@joerogan yo I just watched your BlackBelt presentation from 2012 &amp; I loved the speech. I've been wanting to change my life for a long time but I'm in a mental rut I can't get out of. You're a hell of an inspiration man &amp; please continue being one of the realest people out there.
"@joerogan It takes about 20 seconds to pass out a mountain lion &amp; another 5-6 minutes of suffocating to actually kill it. So unless you're gonna hold a mountain lion in a chokehold for 5 minutes after it passes out, I'm calling bullshit. But hey, if I found a dead lion that's what I'd say!"
"Come on now people. Liam Neeson opens up &amp; says he's ashamed because he once had a racist thought &amp; then everyone calls him a racist. Yet all week ever since this Governor Northam debacle, we've been saying we need to open up dialogue &amp; discuss these things honestly. Which is it?"
