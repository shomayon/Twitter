7 THE COLORS ON THIS BEKS AMAZING
3 13 recalling information in a coherent way is difficult so in the workplace people are often confused to what i m talking about i m not very good at making sales because of this
2 13 writing essays has become increasingly difficult but my strengths have flipped from english and history to math and science since being diagnosed
3 13 my first semester was extremely difficult i couldn t remember anything and i was constantly forgetting to do assignments so i made pretty bad grades
8 13 schizophrenia in school work is hard to deal with the cognitive symptoms really take a toll it was really hard for me in highschool and without my friend helping remember dates i probably would be making really bad grades in rn in college
2 i remember vividly drawing that how was that from 2015 wtf

4 reporting profiles on instagram is a nightmare i tried so hard to report an profile for posting hate but everytime i tried it would send me to the help desk to tell me how but the that just tells you to report it in the app

0 moodboard
3 12 soft things keep me from hallucinating feelings or sensations so when i sleep i like to have something soft i also date my water bottles so that i don t drink any from a different day since someone poisoning my water bottles is a constant fear of mine
4 12 coping mechanisms i cope by usually distracting myself 24 7 by creating stimuli i can avoid the ones my brain creates i usually have to have background noise as much as possible to keep myself occupied so i don t hallucinate i sleep with headphones in and my lights on

0 reaper
5 comatose SO BEAUTIFUL
0 i found the beef
6 11 we re also weird we say things differently we act differently we experience things differently people will call the cops on us during psychotic episodes it s hard to be open about it
7 11 telling employers that you have schizophrenia when applying for a job usually doesn t end well people are afraid of us and they ll do anything to avoid us
7 11 because schizophrenia is so stigmatized it s hard not to be thrown into a mental institution i ve resisted it twice the thought of being put in a hospital is terrifying to me i m afraid to be honest to any medical professional because of how easy it is to be thrown in 1
3 10 i have only been diagnosed with depression anxiety and schizophrenia and most people with schizophrenia have depression and anxiety as well it s not uncommon to have psychotic depression or psychotic BPD psycosis goes hand and hand with lots mental illnesses
4 9 schizophrenic representation in the media is usually fear mongering horror characters or villains we need positive role models for people with schizophrenia i guarantee you that most of us need it to remind ourselves that we aren t the monsters that we think we are

6 BIG AGREE
0 1 17
2 a girl just stopped me and asked me if i was an elementary school student
6 7 we don t deserve to be feared we are just like you if anything we re more likely to hurt ourselves rather than anyone else if someone you know tells you they have schizophrenia accept them and know that they trust you enough to know
3 7 some of us hear voices that tell us to hurt people but those people deserve respect too i m so scared of hurting my friends bc of the stigma it s unreal i have so many nightmares where i kill my friends and i wake up afraid and in tears
2 7 even a lot of people in the mental health field think we re dangerous i told my therapist that i heard voices and she immediately tried to put me in a mental institution we are not inherently more dangerous than any other person
4 7 stigma everyone and their mom knows the stigma surrounding schizophrenia people think we re crazy unfeeling monsters who follow what the voices tell us people think we re murderers or horrible people due to horror movies portraying us
6 OH I LOVE THEM I WANT TO KNOW ALL ABT THEM
0
8 6 i also have SUUUUCH a shit memory like it s crazy i forget what i m saying as soon as it leaves my mouth
0 O
5 6 in general thinking is hard and understanding is hard i ask a lot of questions just because my brain doesn t make connections like it should i describe it as my brain has multiple trains of thought that switch tracks all the time
9 6 i totally read the 6th prompt wrong but that s ironically a perfect segway to explaining cognitive symptoms these include slow thinking difficulty understanding poor concentration and memory and difficulty
0 6 positive symptoms are usually treatable by antipsychotics but negative symptoms require therapy and a lot of practice
0 6 we also experience echolalia which is the repetitive behavior of spoken words basically sometimes i just say the same thing over and over again sorry if it s annoying but it s completely involuntary
2 6 people with schizophrenia often sit or walk in different ways i usually sit in positions that many people say is weird or funny but feel natural to me these movements maybe be repetitive or restless but they are all involuntary
6 6 often times people with schizophrenia just stop all together i do this often i sit and stare at something and nothing is going on in my brain it s like dissociation but i can t move or talk and i m often in a weird position this is called catanoia
3 6 positive symptoms these include hallucinations delusions disorganized speech thinking disorganized behavior catatonic movement and behaviors since i ve already talked abt hallucinations delusions and speech i ll talk about the other ones

2 JacobTheBear Plus it doesn t seem to be as commonly done in England as it does in America But hey I am a newbie in this area Thank you
1 2 First one is too busy
2 JacobTheBear This thread honestly I ve represented a few companies through my cosplay in the past and either they never seemed to work out very professionally or I d end up chasing for info from someone who s disappeared
1 JacobTheBear Ahh I guess that s true Coming from a cosplay community into the more gaming focused streaming community etc it s difficult to gauge how it all goes down I personally would still feel weird going to a company asking for a sponsor but then I am new
0 JacobTheBear I ve been told to contact people about sponsorships but feel if I were to do that it comes across entitled and rude If a company wants to sponsor a content creator they ll find them on the radar and then decide themselves without prejudgements about their character
Imo tho
