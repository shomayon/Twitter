@ChrisCuomo Trumpsters only want to stick a finger in the eye of the left.  Many of them, based on demographics, have little economic skin in the game and most likely little understanding of the way Washington functions.  I feel sad to say this, but it‚Äôs true.
@SenSchumer Much of the drop in the unemployment number is caused by baby boomers like me who retirement age and dropped out of the workforce. Economists have been predicting this natural attrition for decades.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo The highlight of this segment was when the woman on the panel identified her cresitials to be discussing matters such as interpretations of the 14th Amendment.   #flytheracistskis
@douglaslstwit @Reuters @realDonaldTrump In the public companies world this type of behavior would lead to civil and potentially criminal penalties, and derivative law suits.  Manipulator In Chief.
@Reuters Trump is willing to risk the stability of the financial markets to make a sorry attempt to influence the mid terms. Is there a bottom to where Trump is willing to go?  Joe Kernan, a Trump acolyte, called his dubious Tweet a ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù message.  Nice try Joe.
@JacobAWohl A couple of amateurs playing in the big boy league are going to jail. Bring the lube boys...
@PostRoz Roger Stone is such a blatant and pathological liar that he may not be indictable.  Since he made his entire career by lying and embellishing his own influence, his testimony may not be worth taking.  Mueller could easily get him on a perjury charge and get him to cooperate.
@RawStory Even if he did nothing, he should still be indicted for making a mockery of fashion.  He is a complete fool.
@SethAbramson Bannon plea deal in the works. He will be a key witness in proving collusion and with these emails that Bannon provided, he is setting the stage for more indictments.   Stone will eventually cooperate, as well. All roads will lead to Don Jr.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump He may as well draft his order on toilet paper..:
@SenSchumer Really?  That‚Äôs not what the record shows.  Maybe you can make it happen by Executive Order.
@tattoopeeco @anthonythehero @realDonaldTrump There is only one way to repeal birthright citizenship.  Amend the Constitution.  Trump has NO Executive Authority to amend the Constitution.
@realDonaldTrump My wife‚Äôs family came to the shores of what would become the North America in 1630, when they stepped off the merchant ship Lyon in Plymouth Plantation.  My family came here to fight for England in the French and Indian War.  Trump‚Äôs family came here to open a brothel.
@EdKrassen These are the acts of a political party looking down the barrel of a flurry of indictments that will place their party leader into the middle of a conspiracy against the nation. T minus 6 days....
@Jack_Burkman Jack, remember when you go into the pen, the top bunk is for the fresh fish.  Unless your cell mate tells you to ‚Äúsleep‚Äù with him... üò≥üò´
@JacobAWohl @Jack_Burkman You‚Äôre going to jail guys.  Start packing your bags and get some lube.   I‚Äôll send you both a wedding present.
@Goofynetty1941 @Jack_Burkman This false rumor is right up there with the death panel rumors in the 2016 election.  The GOP picks on the naive and manipulates then with fake news.
@Jack_Burkman You‚Äôre really desperate for attention.  Mueller is LOVED be every FBI Agent in, and retired from, the bureau.  An attack on the Hammer is an attack on the Agency.  You may want to practice your purp walk.
@JonLemire These are beyond desperate moves by an administration that knows that the piper is coming to collect his debts.  I suspect that, based on the outcome of the elections, Trump and his acolytes will be in a full on propaganda mode to create a civil disturbance and distraction.
@CNNPR @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Sarah Sanders will always be remembered as the Baghdad Bob of the Trump Administration.  I hope she‚Äôs banking her government paycheck.
@tomperriello Bloomberg turned $10m he earned into $50B.  That‚Äôs entrepreneurship.  Trump isn‚Äôt even a $1B.  Deutsche Bank pegged his wealth at $700M and he sued them.  The case was later withdrawn.
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS 80% of what you cite as Trump wins are the tail wind effects of the Obama recovery.  Sorry Jim, you probably didn‚Äôt take economics at Ohio State.   I took it at Harvard.
@leonbergers @TwitterMoments Most mass shooters are white males.  Most take their own life.  The PBurg police showed great restraint in taking this cretin alive.
@TwitterMoments This is another example of where the public should report persons on social media who regularly espouse hate speech and make threats.  This nut job had a carry permit.  If there was a report made of his activities on social media, there may have been a different better outcome.
@foxillinois The Van is adorned with praise for Trump!
@CNNPolitics You see, Clapper and Brennan saw the intel about the collusion between Trump and Russian agents to get damaging information about Hillary and to coordinate propaganda on social media.  They know how much he runs scared.
@RepMarkMeadows Nice try Traitor.  You know that Mueller is going to drop a world of hurt on Trump after the midterms and you and some of your fellow Kremlin acolytes in the GOP are doing anything to change the narrative.  Trump‚Äôs Russian connections has always been well know on Wall Street.
@RonWyden @realDonaldTrump When the President travels he is mandated to take AF1.  As much as I don‚Äôt like Trump, he is the President.
@YosemiteNPS Some of our National Parks provide tourist access to once in a lifetime experiences that are also inherently risky.  Half Dome and Bridal Falls In Yosimite, as well as the Geyser Basin in Yellowstone come to mind.  The rest is up to the tourist to make good decisions.
@issk01 @ABC And gives Avenetti all of the legal tools available for his own defense.  Including Subpeona power.
@LisaMarieBoothe @Bicked_Wetch @ABC I don‚Äôt see how an inquiry helps anyone.  It can only reopen the pain for all parties and could result in more problems for Kavanaugh.
@txsweettar225 @rogofflaw @ABC So why reopen this matter.  If the Senate refers this to the DOJ for prosecution it will give the defense team the ability to subpoena Kavanaugh and other witnesses.  It could open Pandora‚Äôs Box.
@Kosoglad @rogofflaw @ABC @MichaelAvenatti And very dangerous.  It can give Avenetti and his lawyers the ability to subpoena Kavanaugh and other witnesses if this goes to prosecution.
@ABC So you‚Äôre going to start a criminal investigation for Avenetti and not for Jared, Don Jr., and all the other Trump cronies who clearly lied to the Senate. Little Donny‚Äôs lie was admitted to in his emails he released regarding the Trump Tower Meeting.
@johncardillo @BenjiBacker Hey John.  I‚Äôve accomplished much more than you or Trump. Harvard BA, Georgetown JD, LLM, worked on Iran Contra, went to a major IB and raised more than $600B in Capital creating more 2M jobs.  Now can I say something? You‚Äôre full of shit and Un-American.
@johncardillo This was attempted assassination of two former Presidents, you fucking cretin.  Newsmax is nothing more than a rag for the Kremlin propaganda office.
@TonyAlison3 @MikeTokes @DineshDSouza Typical red neck..
@KSD371 @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @HallieJackson A former MD at Goldman told me Trump is worth maybe $700M. Also, he hasn‚Äôt been able to borrow in the US Credit markets since 1996.  How did he do so many highly leveraged deals? Nostrovia.  Mueller knows all of this.  The clock is ticking...
@LaurelMCarlson1 @Jim_Jordan That is a ridiculous comment.
@Jim_Jordan Hey Congressman Bone Head... they‚Äôre 1,200 miles from the US border and they will be stopped at the US Border Crossing to be evaluated for asylum.  Stop spreading your red meat lies.  Go police the showers at Ohio State...
@andrehalliday1 Trump only things that the execution of the coverup is a problem, not the execution of an innocent human being.  Trump is an amoral prick.
@johnoco27453655 @CNNBusiness That‚Äôs because Trump‚Äôs 2016 supporters have returned to their normal diet of opioids and Sponge Bob.
@CNNBusiness @cnnbrk The volatility of the markets is a real warning sign and indicates the dangerous geopolitical and trade policies of the Trump Administration.  Bell-weather companies like MMM and CAT are indicating a global economic slowdown being strained by material costs.
@imfrankabignail @sltrib @UUtah Respect this young lady‚Äôs life by shutting your racist gob!
@kobratrading @thetimes Fuck You
@thetimes Clearly, the likes of Sean Hannity and his scumbag cadre at FOX is responsible for spreading fear about this octogenarian billionaire.  What about the Mercer, Murdoch and Koch families?  How does Soros‚Äô support of his politics differ from their support?  1st Amendment!!
@_drudgereport_ Caterpillar and 3M, both bell-weathers for cap ex and corporate investment reported poorer than expected performance and issues a poor forecast.   Both companies are supply chain and materials sensitive and are indicating the real effects of Trump Trade War.
@Newsweek I would take this with much more concern if Trump has the intelligence to under the history and bad outcomes from Nationalistic leaders.
@thehill Really??? While Congress is out of town for the next two weeks?  Another Trillion Dollar added to the deficit?  Desperate promises from a desperate criminal.
@robreiner Time for a Democrat Controlled House to investigate Kushner and Trump business relationships with foreign governments.  Obviously, the cash strapped Kushner and Trump orgs are courting the Saudis for investment.
@itsbigginge I would have clocked the guy if I was on the plane.  No doubt.
Old white guys seem to feel immune to getting knocked out for racist and hostile behavior.
@nytimes What makes these old violent guys think that they can‚Äôt get knocked the F out?
@alwaysdobetter @NewDay There is NO IMMINENT Threat.  There is only a labor shortage.  We need more workers because the welfare dependent white trash won‚Äôt work.
@NewDay @mschlapp Matt,  you just had your fat ass handed to you on CNN.  You will not address the President‚Äôs chronic lying and make up your own facts to support your bull shit agenda.  I just looked up the asylum numbers on DHS and THREE applications were granted in August 2018.
Sanders 2020? Many Bernie backers aren't feeling it via @POLITICO for iOS.   Bernie, your time is over.

@Jim_Jordan Are you really as stupid as you seem?  Your guy, Trump is going down after the Mid-terms.  As a former NYC banker, I can 100% assure you that Trump had been receiving funding from the Russians since 1998.  Most of which was dirty money never disclosed by Trump.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews When the Dems take the House they will INVESTIGATE to no end.  Reopen the Closed Russia Investigation and call all those witnesses who the GOP refused to put in the chair.  Make every hearing public, when not classified.  Call Rodger Stone, Jared, Don Jr., Ivanka, Cohen...
@cnnbrk Trump has no knowledge of Lee, nor the fact that Ohio was not part of the Confederacy. He is a complete and embarrassing Moron.  He relies on the vote of people who only support him because he represents their most vile and racist values.
@andrewrsorkin Thank you for putting principles before business and not attending g Davos in the Desert.  If only our president had such valor.
@SenDuckworth Trump disparages the CMOH and his base pretends it never happened. Just like all the other cowardous acts that Trump has committed in the past and now.
@50cent Please send Kanye some Kryptonite.
@RepAdamSchiff We need to get Trump out of the WH and restore America‚Äôs leadership role and reputation in the World.
@AriFleischer Never heard you say this about the Tea Party you gutless hypocrite.
@senatemajldr @ChuckGrassley @senjudiciary @POTUS Hey Mitch, the nation is not as Conservative as you think.  Get out of your turtle shell more often!
@realDonaldTrump How did your meeting with Kanye the day after Hurricane Micheal demolished Florida‚Äôs Gulf Coast help the people who lost everything?
@senatemajldr @POTUS It‚Äôs apparent that you only keep Trump around for his ‚Äúsignature‚Äù and at the expense of our Naton‚Äôs reputation, safety, integrity and values.  This year Webster will revise the definition of ‚ÄúCoward‚Äù to add [see also GOP leadership].
@AntkneeBrown22 @senatemajldr Now Mitch needs to get this opioid addicted impoverished State straightened out.  He hates Government spending on social programs and yet his State is one big welfare office.  Then again, so is the whole South.
@senatemajldr So is Dr. Ford.
@jimcramer Jim,  former Stockton, NJ neighbor.  How strong we need the S&amp;P to finish today to avoid a big Friday sell off?.  #deadcatbounce
@FortuneMagazine The Markets have been in a 8 year bull market.  The most recent bull run was greatly driven by the Tax Bill as investors run to equity at a more favorable tax rate.  Buyback and special dividends are played out.  If we don‚Äôt get a strong finish today, tomorrow will be blood bath.
@RepSwalwell @JeffFlake @SenBobCorker @SenatorCollins @SenSasse Lindsey Graham was once tough on Trump. But, now he‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs Minister of Propaganda.
@axios Amb. Haley is smart to leave this Administration now if she wants to make a run at the WH in 2020 or more likely 2024.  The shit is about to hit the fan after the mid-terms and and the new Congress in January she doesn‚Äôt want the association.
@TwitterMoments Just get out this November and vote for any Democrat on the ticket in your district and state. We got to put an end to this nightmare!
@TwitterMoments If he Vanka‚Äòs father wasn‚Äôt Donald Trump should be working at the perfume counter at Costco. Give me a break!

@peterhaskell880 @wcbs880 Manslaughter for limo company operator.  10,000lbs vehicle carrying 4,000lbs of passengers needs the maximum functioning brakes to stop.  I‚Äôm sure he had his foot to the floor.  I bet they find ruptured brake lines.
@StaceyDelikat @fox5ny Brake failure.
@TwitterMoments Brake failure, distracted driver, or physical impairment....  so sad.  So many parentless children today.
The real story here is that in prior Senate Confirmation hearings for his seat on the Fed 2nd beach, Kavanaugh lies about his involvement in the review of the OLC‚Äôs policy on Enhanced Interrogation.
@senatemajldr You owe it to American people to leave the Senate and return to your Shit Hole impoverished state of Kentucky.  As a wealthy elitists living in NJ, I am sick of supporting the teen pregnancies and meth addictions of your constituents.  #southernerssuck
@lynjjzano @senatemajldr Wishful thinking sweetheart. McConnell just lost every college educated woman and millennials for the next 2 generations.
@realDonaldTrump Kavanaugh lied about having no role in the drafting of the Enhanced Interrogation directive during the Bush administration. There is no way that his boss, TEF, would have not brought him into the tent.  He lied to Sen. Leahy impeachable. Provable when the Dems get subpoena power.
Another example as a need for term limits.  When an elected tile become a career and not a public service it is time to move on.  Two terms for Senate, three terms for House.
Do squats and lunges!
This is so ridiculously pathetic.
@SenateDems @SenSchumer @SenFeinstein Please, let‚Äôs move on.  The longer this stays in the news cycle it rallies Trump‚Äôs base and distracts from issues like the Trump Family Tax Fraud.  Pick your battles..
@VMT9201 @TwitchyTeam The FBI is not in anyone‚Äôs pocket.  They conduct investigations and report the findings.  They found nothing that corroborated the subject allegations and that‚Äôs trust.
The GOP can‚Äôt survive on white trash voters.  They‚Äôve pushed anybody with more than a 7th grade education away from their party.  Maybe Honey Boo Boo can run on the GOP ticket in 2024.
@AP Mitch McConnell cites underhanded tactics of the Democrats as a threat to the selection of Supreme Court Justice. This is the same MF‚Äôer who held Scalia‚Äôs seat open for 320 days so that a duly elected president could not appoint a Justice.
@PeterAlexander Trump goes to deplorable, impoverished and racist Mississippi and feels safe to attack an assault victim for the sake of his own low self esteem.  He gets laughs from a crowd that most likely is 50% undereducated, underemployed and living on blue state taxes.  Another Shit Hole.
@PeterAlexander More like a punching bag.  Kellyanne is a walking bullshit dispenser.
@atrupar @KellyannePolls I have a degree from Harvard and a JD and LLM from Georgetown.  In my professional and esteemed opinion, Kellyanne is a cunt.  I‚Äôve met her husband George and he is a very nice man.  I have no idea why he stays with her.
@jdawsey1 Trump is such a disgraceful example of a man.  And so is any man who supports his sexist and abusive behavior. As a father of two daughters I can‚Äôt believe that we have to listen to this scumbag destroy our Nation‚Äôs reputation.  #fucktrump
@susannecraig Is there also a chance that, based on these findings, Trump filed fraudulent financial reports in his bankruptcy petitions. Also, the worst kept secret on Wall Street is that Trump went to Russians for funding after his access to US Capital after 1998.
@JohnCornyn Sen Cornyn, you are a complete disgrace.  Comparing a woman‚Äôs right to report her memory of a sexual assault is not tantamount to the McCarthy Hearings.  I hope you don‚Äôt have daughters.
@smotus The GOP has to decide between appeasing their dysfunctional leader or upholding what little moral fiber is left in the Party.  Kavanaugh‚Äôs outburst about Clinton conspiracies and leftwing propaganda should impeach him as an independent presence on the Court.
@CBSNews Lindsey sees his 2020 Primary loss in a clearer light after Dr. Ford wins America‚Äôs Heart.  He goes nuts knowing that Kavanaugh is taking on water fast.
@TwitterMoments The Academy Nominates Senator Lindsey Graham for Best Actor in his roll as Trump‚Äôs Whore during the Ford / Kavanaugh hearings.  You are witnessing a man throw all morality to the wind in order to glean the blessings of the Great Leader.  John McCain is crying...
@JohnBerman Judge Kavanaugh keeps asserting the written statement by Mark Judge as evidence of his innocence, but will not agree that Mr. Judge should be subpoenaed to assess his credibility.  Simple first year Law School stuff...
Having worked for Michael Bromwich in the early ‚Äò90s at Mayer, Brown and Platt, I don‚Äôt see him taking on a client that is not creditable.  He was a great mentor and it‚Äôs wonderful seeing his calm and thoughtful demeanor counseling Dr. Ford.  #KavanaughHearings
He has completely lost his mind.  Time for the 25th Amendment!!
@cnnbrk I got chills when I heard Trump her laughed at today at the UN when he claimed to have the ‚Äúmost successful first two years in the history of our Nation‚Äù.  You have to be kidding me.. the American Presidency just got mocked a ridiculed by World Leaders.  Now that‚Äôs a first.
@JoelRobcrazy8 @karenhunter @TomiLahren First of all it‚Äôs ‚Äúyou‚Äôre‚Äù.   Second, you have no sense of macro economics if you think that the saving of the auto industry was not a no brainer to save  the mid-west, and the bail out of the banks was under Bush and was an absolute neccesity to keep the nation solvent.
@karenhunter @TomiLahren She was watching Jersey Shore during the Obama years.  Please don‚Äôt confuse her with facts.
@TomiLahren By what measure?  147% increase in the DJIA, Unemployment from 9.3% to 4.2%, lowered leverage in the credit markets (you probably have NO idea what this means), saved 1M jobs by saving the auto industry, oversaw and orders the operation to capture OBL.....
@TomiLahren Why should we listen to a little girl who was doing keg stands at the fine intellectual Mecca (UNLV üòÇ) during the Obama years? Please, there‚Äôs a million hot blonde lady out there. You‚Äôre just an empty mouth, most of the time.
@TomiLahren I don‚Äôt listen to poorly educated (UNLV) little 26 year olds who play to the Libidos of trailer trash.  Tomi (is that your porn name?), you are as much an expert on politics as I am a thoracic surgeon.  How about you spare us your trolling commentary?
@peterbakernyt Who keeps a calendar of parties in High School and College? He should withdraw from consideration just for that ultra-geeky behavior.
@DeanObeidallah @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump McConnell abused the power of the Senate to usurp the authority of the Executive Office under Art. 2 of the Constitution.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Are you f‚Äôing kidding us??? The GOP Senate usurped Obama‚Äôs Article 2 authority to block the appointment of Merrick Garland.  Kavanaugh‚Äôs appointment is a complete sham.  How stupid do you think we are, Lindsay. I used to respect you.  No longer.
@davidaxelrod @ChrisCuomo @realDonaldTrump Trump supporters live in a fantasy world.  They either don‚Äôt have the capacity to understand long term economic trends, or they have selective memory to feed their delusional view of this Presidency.  Or Both.
@kylegriffin1 I can believe that 32% of the sample group approve this buffoon‚Äôs performance.
@President Revoke any Gun license he has..
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @CLewandowski_ I could care less what Cory or any other taking head says.  It‚Äôs what Mueller finds that‚Äôs most important.  I have a hunch his report will show significant and ongoing financial connections with Russian creditors, potential money laundering arrangements and tax fraud.
@AP HahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahHhahahahahHahahahah! Failed Alt Right.
@NBCNews For all those complaining about this action by twitter:  Twitter exercised its proprietary right to restrict use of its services.  Just like the baker who refused to make a cake for a same sex marriage.  Twitter finds Alex Jones to be a violation of their guiding principles.
@pattersonjeffa @pompeygommy @NBCNews It‚Äôs not.  That‚Äôs the point.  Twitter exercised its proprietary right to restrict use of its services.  Just like the baker who refused to make a cake for a same sex marriage.  Twitter finds Alex Jones to be a violation of their guiding principles.
@goldengateblond Goodbye Alex!! Hahaha
@Slate This guy makes Trump look like an adult.  His personal attack on Senator Rubio was that of a playground bully.   Alex Jones is an example of how the internet has changed our world and discourse.

@ChrisPaulComedy Lodestar is an old Slovak word.
@Jennifer_Tc0616 Let‚Äôs hope so..
@nytimes And when the Washington Post ran a story about a cover up and attributed it to an anonymous source named Deep Throat, everybody doubted that too. #BobWoodward
@Averre13 @ChristianInst @nytimes If the person is known to them as credible and holding a position in the WH to have direct knowledge of the allegations, they would grant anonymity to the author.
@ChristianInst @nytimes Sort of like the Bible.  It‚Äôs all just an imaginary tale.  #sataninthewhitehouse
Alex, you just lost your FCC license for threatening a US Senator.
@cnnbrk Mueller doesn‚Äôt need a face to face interview to finish the report on collusion.  He already has adequate testimony and evidence to tie Trump to the Trump Tower meeting and thereby establishing intent for obstruction.
@ABCPolitics Recent primary wins in the Dem party (Pressley tonight) are showing a generational shift in the party attracting younger voters to more left leaning and younger candidates.  The GOP is worried as their older constituents die off.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Please stop putting your buddy Anthony on the show.  He is such a little BSer and lowlife.  He has no idea what‚Äôs going on in the WH now and makes it all up.  Just another Wall Street conman.

@je_cooper @CortesSteve @CNN Soon the be renamed Bloomberg Tower...
@je_cooper @CortesSteve @CNN The GOP‚Äôs definition of elite is educated, hard working responsible families who see the future of America‚Äôs economic growth in our expanding participation in the global markets.  GOP Mantra: ‚Äúkeep em dumb and down‚Äù.
@skeeter_2003 @CortesSteve @CNN Mr. Cortes is a paid manure spreader for a corrupt political party.
@CortesSteve @CNN Steve, I‚Äôm a Harvard educated, self made elite and proud of it.

We libs pay the bills.
@DLoesch This is complete bullshit being pushed by the right.  Less than 20% of applications to the FISA bench result in the issuance of a warrant.  The FBI showed the judge f compelling evidence to get the warrant issued.  End of story.

@Andre_Sagovia @BillOReilly Go fuck yourself.
@BillOReilly @Scaramucci And the President that you supported attacked him for ‚Äúbeing caught‚Äù and tortured in Vietnam while Trump chased women around at Penn.  Bill, you‚Äôre a complete scumbag.  McCain doesn‚Äôt want Trump at his funeral and you can stay home too.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @KellyannePoll I certainly appreciate your persistence, but you are dealing with a criminal and psychotic Anti-American Administration in a panic.  I just hope that their behavior is never forgotten.
@NBCPolitics Coming soon, the opening of the newly renamed Bloomberg Tower.
@AP This State action is outside of Trump‚Äôs pardon authority and exposes his family to potential felony convictions.  Any serious findings in this investigation will  push Trump over the brink.  That is of he‚Äôs still in Office.
@nytimes And a white, employed American Dad murdered his two little girls and wife.  Why didn‚Äôt Sarah mention that murder at today‚Äôs presser?
@CBSNews America‚Äôs low point.  We have an administration built on lies and disregard for the rule of law.  Time to change Congress and #impeach Trump.

@realDonaldTrump Who at the Pentagon was man enough to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs a stupid idea and the military hates you‚Äù?
@TexasTribune McRaven is universally respected in the services and Special Ops as a leader who would still get in the shit with the team.   He‚Äôs a true Patriot and Warrior who isn‚Äôt afraid to express what all the military feels about Trump.
@BruceBr33549356 @TexasTribune Because he has more than 40 years of experience as an Intelligence Officer and can be used as a resource by a responsible White House.  Trump only hires cronies who could find their car keys.
@ChrisCuomo Brennan has been for the past two years alluding to his direct knowledge of Trump‚Äôs collusion with the Russians to influence the 2016 election.  He would know since he was involved with the intel gathering before the election.
@ChrisCuomo The offenses that Trump has committed on America and our Constitution are immeasurable.  He has, with the assistance of the GOP, turned our Executive branch into an Authoritarian Daycare.  Hjs childish and vindictive comments and actions have diminished our global leader role.
@ChrisCuomo The same reason why every Bush Admin. official, except for Libby, still have their Security Clearance.   To advise on and report out their experiences while in their classified roles in government.  Although Trump has no respect or knowledge of history.  I really is important.
@ABCPolitics Big deal.  Brennan hasn‚Äôt accessed classified information since he left the government.  He already read and heard the intercepts of Trump Campaign Officials conspiring with Russian Intel.  Now he‚Äôll really hammer Trump.

@washingtonpost When does a political agenda like this become obstructuon?  Something Mueller should consider.  Clearly Nunes has expressed his intent to obstruct the Mueller Investigation to protect Trump.
@washingtonpost Nunes will go down in history as Trump‚Äôs bag man and a traitor to America.  He will overlook any and all crimes and acts against the Nation perpetrated by Trump to further his party‚Äôs agenda of intolerance and racism.
@RepChrisCollins It appears to be a very easy case of a 10b-5 violation felony and perjury and Chris and his sons are going to jail, paying fines and disgorging profits.
@TwitterMoments The chickens are coming home in earnest.   LOCK HIM UP!!!ü§¨ü§¨
@RepChrisCollins Rep. Collins just charged with Securities Fraud. HahahahahabababababababababBbhahahahahbaüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£. Just made my day!!! Another Trump propagandist indicted.

@baker52160 @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo As a former Wall Street banker who worked on one of Trump‚Äôs syndicated loans (which he later defaulted on to a tune of $900M) I assure you that Trump‚Äôs ONLY access to capital after 1997 was from the Russians. He is compromised.
@Shortguy1 @ChrisCuomo @CNN It‚Äôs only degrading when it‚Äôs reporting what you‚Äôre afraid to here about your illegitimate great leader.
@teamdoc4sports @ChrisCuomo Trump will be making jail house wine and grilled cheese on a hot plate. You!
@ChrisCuomo Chris, as the evidence and self incrimination stacks up against Trump, and the likelihood of conspiracy and a cover up of the same is all but a sure thing.  The true test is whether America is willing to have a traitor in the Oval Office only to reach their own political agenda.
@mkraju Suckitlow is a complete liar and really bad at it too.  Little Donny needs to be called before the Senate to get his story straight.
@RealDonaldTrFan Don just confessed to Obstructuon this morning when he tweeted verbatim that ‚Äúthe [Trump Tower] meeting was intended to get information on a political opponent‚Äù.   In the statement he admitted to draft states that the meeting was about adoption.  Slam dunk obstruction.
@ManafortDefense I‚Äôd like to contribute a bag of bullshit to add to all the other bullshit you seditious traitors are dumping on the American people.  This case is a slam dunk against Paul.  The evidence and testimony this week has been devastating for Paul and he will flip by week 3.
@PaulManafort You may make Madoff look like a petty thief after this trial is over.  You are deranged K Street scum and we‚Äôll take joy in watching you rot in jail.  Redeem yourself and your family and tell Mueller how Trump conspired again the Nation.
@cnnbrk Mueller never asks a question he can‚Äôt already answer and never wastes time with the wrong person.  He‚Äôs going to let Stone sweat it out and then take him off the street in a very public arrest.  Stone will sing like a Bird to save his own ‚Äúass‚Äù from a lifetime incarceration.
@martinchulov @levenephoto She gave birth to a mass murderer.  What could she say that matters?
@RealJamesWoods @Sarabellag James; you forgot to include Russian eligibility to vote you stupid seditious washed up f@ck.
@EricTrump @Sarabellag @seanhannity @FoxNews My friend‚Äôs daughter knew Eric well at Georgetown.  She said he was dumb as a house plant.
@Sarabellag @cnnbrk Did you sign a NDA, too?
@CaptSluis @SageRosenfels18 @AriFleischer And have you seen the entire evidence file?  If so, please tell!!
@AriFleischer Hey Ari,  you‚Äôre irrelevant.  Your glory days of bullshitting for W are over.  Now you‚Äôre just a Troll.  There is NO comparison between what Bill Clinton did, mostly through his lawyers, and the propaganda war Trump is conducting from the WH.
@kylegriffin1 And we pay the club for every day Trump uses the facilities and lodging.  What a joke!  We‚Äôre all getting f‚Äôd and we‚Äôre not even invited for dinner.  As if I‚Äôd go to that shithole.
@JenniferJJacobs @margarettalev I‚Äôm leaving my Hunterdon County NJ horse farm for the next 11 days.  I couldn‚Äôt have better timing. I actually thought somebody was spreading manure.  I live just a few miles from Bedminster.  Why doesn‚Äôt Trump hold a rally in NJ?  Maybe because we know he‚Äôs full of shit.
@nprpolitics Trump is a desperate man.  He knows that Manafort, Don Jr., and a slew of others can put him in jail for a long time.  Maybe, just maybe, I President can‚Äôt be indicted.  But, if I were Trump, I wouldn‚Äôt rely on a memo from the Office of Legal Counsel to sleep well at night.
@thehill DeVos never took a loan to pay tuition in her life.  She has no touch with reality.
@SenatorTimScott Obama beat 4.1% four times and the whole economy is now deficit financed by the taxpayers.
@JanMorgan_ I guess you can‚Äôt make enough money stripping.  I can see why.  How dare you invoke veterans on CNN this morning to support your asinine position on 3D guns.  I doubt you served other than servicing vets in the VIP Room at the base gentlemen‚Äôs club.
@ChrisCuomo Most of what Trump is doing and has already done was predicted before the 2016 election.  Elections Matter.
@cnnbrk Another Trump lie... when will they end?
@cnnbrk Distract, Distraction as the Manafort Trial begins.  This is the work of half-a-man who puts the Nation behind his own self interest and knows that his days are numbered.   #patheticpresident
@cnnbrk There must be a psychological connection between religious devotion and sexual deviance.  It happens far to often to be a mere coincidence.  Hyper-religious beliefs are already considered a form of Mania, so there must be some connection.
@cnnbrk Welcome to the future of Climate Change.
@RonanFarrow @NewYorker Tone at the Top is a deciding factor for a healthy corporate culture, or a toxic corporate culture.  Casting a blind eye to these rumors in the Board Room is just gasoline on the fire.
@cnnbrk What‚Äôs wrong with Texas?  Too much dust and heat?  To little focus on education and too much focus on football?  Or, just genetically challenged.  Can we still give them back to Mexico?
@gilbob69 @CillizzaCNN @ChrisCuomo @CuomoPrimeTime Hey, You must have gone to Trump U.  It‚Äôs You‚Äôre not your.  Idiot.
@cnnbrk It turned out to be a box of money for Trump to launder.
@JayDavidMurphy @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Shrinking as of last month...
@RyannMcEnany @realDonaldTrump Hey economic genius!  This is quarter to quarter growth, not year over year...  4.1% doesn‚Äôt beat Obama‚Äôs top four q-to-q increases.  It‚Äôs not really Big News.  Job growth and hourly wage both retracted last month.
@FoxNews @AmericaNewsroom Inflation on its way.  More pain for the forgotten middle class..
@CNBCnow He can thank Obama and his policies for saving the US economy from a second depression and leaving him with a strong tailwind.  Let‚Äôs see how this economic growth helps the middle class and not just the top 5%.  Fed will raise rates again...
@ABCPolitics The irony of this is beyond belief.  Here is a President and Secretary of Education who have never had to worry about making a tuition payment for themselves or their children, limiting the only protection that the average American is againt the likes of Trump U.
DeVos to cut estimated $13 billion in federal loan relief for defrauded students - ABC News - https://t.co/EPRaiw3Yj9 via @ABC
@JumboElliott76 There is NO done trade deal with the EU.  Even if there was a deal and the EU bought the amount of soy beans they purchased last year, $1.6B, it would not even come close making up for the $12B that China is no longer buying for the US Farmers.  He lies and lies and lies.
@mattmfm Trump knows what Mueller found and is getting ready to bunker in the WH and to create havoc in America by spreading propaganda and decisiveness.
@ABCPolitics She is a complete moron.  Has no idea how the average American lives.
@njdotcom I listened to this guy from time to time and was a complete moron pandering to the Trump supporters primarily to the racists of South Jersey.  I‚Äôm glad to see them go.
@CNNPolitics No chance he‚Äôll ever get the speakership.  The Freedom Party has no fundraising strength, plus the Dems will have the House.
@ChrisCuomo When the story doesn‚Äôt fit your false narrative, change the story.  That‚Äôs right out of the Dictator Handbook.
@TwitterMoments All of Trump‚Äôs  businesses are hemorrhaging. Bookings at his properties are down more than 60% since before his campaign. Trump Turnberry is losing millions of dollars a month and soon is Russian lenders will be calling in their debt .
@ChrisCuomo More and more reasons every day to get the Dem vote out.  It‚Äôs no longer a party issue, but an American issue.  The GOP supports, or at least enables, a person who does not exemplify American values and is running over our rule of law and Constitution.
@asandu @ChrisCuomo Trump politicizes judges all the time. There are Trump loyal judges and all the rest are ‚Äúso called judges‚Äù.
@cnnbrk Nunes is now realizing that the FBI and Mueller are running a by the book buttoned down Investigation that has produced overwhelming evidence of obstruction and conspiracy to collude with a foreign enemy in an act against the Nation.
@garcia_huff @SarahMc77981196 @cnnbrk Let‚Äôs not get too hung up on spelling and grammar. Trump is setting the tone at the top when it comes to literacy.
@SarahMc77981196 @cnnbrk Did you mean to say won.  I really think of Trump as more like #two.
@TimRLarson @cnnbrk They have to redact it to protect sources and methods. I read the first 100 pages and it appears that the FBI had more than enough evidence outside of the Dossier to get the FISA warrant. I‚Äôm not sure this helps Nunes and his band of Russian sympathizers.
@kevinslc @ChrisCuomo @KellyJaneFK @realDonaldTrump They‚Äôre all auditioning for future roles at Fox News.  Today I saw Jason Miller defending Trump‚Äôs long list of affairs.   Albeit, Jason himself had a child with A.J. Delgado while his wife was pregnant with their first child.  Scum grows on scum.
@ChrisCuomo Time to review the property sales at Trump properties. Straw purchases abound to launder dirty Russian money.
@realJeffreyLord @ChrisCuomo Jeff, still disregarding facts and spreading untruths and conspiracy theories to defend an indefensible President.  Remember, history survives long after our fragile bodies and you don‚Äôt want to be remembered as a ‚Äúgood German‚Äù.
Doctor for former President George H.W. Bush fatally shot in Houston - CNN https://t.co/wB367aWBnr   This looks like a gang initiation killing to get a ‚ÄúStreet Cred‚Äù.  Disgraceful and cowardly.
@Mikel_Jollett Evangelicals are the poster children for hypocrisy.  They claim to walk in the shoes of Jesus and at the same time support a President who has no respect for religion, family values or the rule of law.  Which of the Ten Commandments has he every followed?
@ksatnews Fast food is fast food and will kill you.  The kid will be better off staying away from deep fried processed fat.
@ksatnews I with I was born at Nobu.
@Acosta @VanityFair I noticed that Trump boarded Marine One alone today.
@BSchnitzDude @DSTucker82 @TwitterMoments @nytimes How many mulligans do the Evangelicals allow?
@TwitterMoments @nytimes NYT reports that in addition to recorded conversations with Trump, there are also recorded conversations with other high profile people and GOP Operatives.  Maybe we can get a two-for and take out Hannity along with Trump.
@BiggySharms @vicenews What matters is that Cohen has audio tapes of conversations with Trump.  Cohen was Trump‚Äôs fixer and would go to him for only matters that border the legal boundaries. Also, depending on when this payment was made, it could be an illegal campaign donation or perjury.
@vicenews Knowing that Trump can‚Äôt be trusted, I‚Äôm sure that Cohen taped all of his conversations with Trump.  Can you believe what treasure trove Mueller has on audio tape.  Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúJohn Dean‚Äù nightmare.
@RayDono63189095 @20committee You can rest assured that she has some form of compromising evidence to influence the political players she screwed.  Wayne LaPierre must be freaking.
Mueller will report that Trump and his Campaign leadership worked with Russia to get OP Research on Hillary Clinton and also that Trump is compromised by financial or personal information known by Russia.   #TrumpKnew #treason
@ElkeC11 @davidhogg111 Everybody in Russia owns and carries a gun.  They don‚Äôt enforce the gun laws and there is a huge black market for guns in the country that is run by the Chechen Mafia and is politically protected.  They don‚Äôt need the NRA, only their political influence.
@NRA Wait until he subpoenas start flying and Wayne and his cadre are sitting on the stand in front of their families telling how they got their .22 Short stuck in the Russian Honey Pot. And if they find out that the NRA was funneling Russian money to the Trump Campaign, well...
@ShellE719 @DLoesch @NRA Dana is helping Wayne get all of the guns out of his house before Mrs. LaPierre finds out that Lil Wayne was dipping his .22 short into the Russian honey pot....ü§¨ü§Ø‚ò†Ô∏è
@cnnbrk N‚ÄôT     ü§™
@cnnbrk Watching it now.  What a pathetic man he is.  He‚Äôs blaming Hillary, Obama, Clapper, Brennan and repeating no collusion.  He‚Äôs completely off the rails.  Impeach Now!!
@normamarcio @realDonaldTrump Actually he said that he believes that there was meddling, but he never mentioned that Russia did it.
@realDonaldTrump And you can thank Obama for leaving you a much healthier economy than he inherited. Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll screw it up...
@ObermeyerRick De Plane, De Plane
@realDonaldTrump How is it that you were cut off from American banks in 1998 and you still were able to capitalize your numerous projects since.?  Was it Russia money..... ?
@realDonaldTrump In spite of you selling the Nation to Russia.
@seanhannity Your a college dropout... period.
@seanhannity Mueller is way ahead of him.  But he‚Äôs a Republican.
@seanhannity Sean, given the fact that you no education to speak of, I am not surprised that you make it up as you go along.  There is NO WAY that GOP leadership is going to touch Mueller, Rosentien or any other person associated with the investigation.
@ASavageNation Another coward right winger spewing hate from behind a mic.
@redwillow553 @SaysHummingbird @48Fan88 Any one of them would be MUCH better than Trump.  Trump is a mental case and criminal.  Having been a banker in NYC for 27 years I‚Äôve seen him in action first hand and he is completely off his nut.
@joncoopertweets Congress should at least begin Impeachment proceedings.  It will not always result in an impeachment, but it does force the consideration and collection of evidence.
@TheDemCoalition Mueller must take advantage of this public display of a treasonous President and deliver more indictments as soon as possible, and especially those for the many Americans who were complicit in the theft of the 2016 election.
@NewsBoycott @RandPaul You meant four years ago....
@jconn217 @DianaMiller5 @GOPMongos @cherylgonz @RandPaul But the impoverished residents of Kentucky love that ‚Äúgubment‚Äù check every month paid for by the deep pockets of the Blue States.
@adamcbest Maybe his neighbor was right.. or was it a left??
@ChrisCuomo A completely pathetic and desperate man.  Eventually he‚Äôll have to surrender his passport. Mueller is closing in and he knows it.
@woodruffbets @timkmak Wayne LaPierre was seen buying adult diapers today.
@TwitterMoments Another Trump by way of NRA connection....
@TwitterMoments He‚Äôs not up to the job.  Fire him!!
@MarshallCohen @sikkbird Most Trump supporters are too poorly educated to understand what Trump did to win the election.  They‚Äôll never understand the treason that Trump has committed.
@LarrySchweikart @MarshallCohen Mueller is getting there.  Don‚Äôt blow your wad yet...
@MarshallCohen @sikkbird Justice Department just brought espionage charges against a Russian National who has infiltrated a US gun rights organization.  Did the NRA illegally funnel Russia money to the Trump Campaign?  Wayne??
@JohnBrennan Brennan has already seen the intel prior to leaving the Cabinet and knows that Trump, his family and certain campaign staff face espionage charges.  Trump knows it too.  Trump supporters should be held socially accountable for their blind support of this traitor President.
@CraziLife9 @TheDemCoalition I completely agree.  I feel similar dire dread as I did on 911. And I lost friends and colleagues that day.
@TheDemCoalition What does Putin have on Trump?  Endless financial ties, explicit sex tapes, a lifetime of espionage, or is he a Manchurian Candidate?  I know it sounds reaching, but after today it is more likely the case.
@JohnBrennan Time to protect Mueller and draft Articles of Impeachment.  Trump is a loose cannon with the ability to destroy the World.
@kylegriffin1 @MSNBC Where can we go now without the GOP deciding to meet their Constitutional charge and Impeach a President who is a clear and present danger to our Nation.
@FoxBusiness @DarrellIssa Issa is complicit in Trump‚Äôs treason...
@ABC There MUST BE resignations over this clear act of treason.  Too many good people are running the day care at the expense of their legacy.
@AriFleischer Ari,  give up the paycheck and become an American....
@AP Will Ferrell‚Äôs famous line from Zoolander:  ‚ÄúHas everyone taken a crazy pill?‚Äù  What the hell just happened.  Trump may as well have walked out to the press conference wearing a dog collar.  A dark day for America.
@ChrisCuomo This is a very dark day for America.  A day when our elected President sides with the leader of our longest and most powerful ‚Äúreal foe‚Äù to end an investigation that HE KNOWS will place him and his family in the annals of history as traitors to the Nation.  So sad.
@AnnCoulter Ann is trolling again.  What‚Äôs the matter Ann, not feeling the love lately. BTW: I‚Äôm Harvard ‚Äò85, not the Fake Ivy, Cornell.... sorry, you‚Äôre not that exceptional.
@ChrisCuomo I‚Äôd love to see if Shine has divested his interest in 21st Century Fox and NewsCorp when he took his communications job in the WH.  Let‚Äôs ask the question.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Roger Stone should be given body protection after this last indictment pegged him as one of the contacts with the Russians.  Putin does not want this connection to come to light.  Watch out for poison tipped umbrellas.
@john_sipher @mikercarpenter It is hard to imagine how Don Jr. will not show up in an indictment. He was the point person for campaign social media.  He also already confessed to meeting with Russian officials and trying to cover it up.
@mikercarpenter The GRU could not have successfully realized their goal to get Trump elected without co-conspirators in the Campaign and or Party.  More indictments coming this month.
@cnnbrk Eventually you realize that your job isn‚Äôt worth your reputation.
@ChrisCuomo After eight years of exile under Obama, I think they are drunk with power now.
@RawStory @ChrisCuomo Mueller knows the real reason for Trump‚Äôs deference to Putin and he‚Äôs sending Trump a message.  ‚ÄúI know what you did.‚Äù
@Mediaite @ChrisCuomo The question of why there were no American co-conspirators names in today‚Äôs indictments?  Because the co-conspirators include Don Jr and Jared.  Mueller does not want to roll out that stick of dynamite too soon and create a Constitutional crisis, yet.
@SauceyQ1 @FoxNews This has NO effect on the Mueller Investigation.  The evidence will be so overwhelming that Congress will have to take action to impeach.
@mttoplulu @FoxNews Mueller has the Deutsche files and has the full chain of custody for Trump finding from Russia. He‚Äôs followed the money!!!
@FoxNews Reviewing the NewsCorp contributions to Mitch McConnell while his wife was on the NEWS Board.  KRM did not disclose it as required in the Annual Report and neither did Mitch.  Stay tuned.
But they are Hillbillies and intelligent hard working NJ millionaires are paying their bills.  So, Eff Them...
This is all for show to get votes for the GOP moron base in November.  This in no way will effect the overwhelming and shocking evidence that Mueller is going to bring to Congress.
