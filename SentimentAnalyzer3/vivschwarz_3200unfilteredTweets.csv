We did not allow them to distribute their zines in school, because it's not healthy discourse if a kid meets another kid at the school gate who hands them a piece of writing called "The Hammer" saying they should be removed, ridiculed, hated, inviting others to join the uprising
They were awful then and we stood up against them as we could, as kids. It's necessary to stand up against them, I can tell you that ignoring them did no good at all, since they loved to beat people up. I mean, obviously.
Looking at German news... The far right recruiting kids in schools and meeting up to talk armed uprising and training in gyms was definitely a thing when I was a kid in Germany, so not totally new. They never really went away, I think.
I caught up with work enough to have the morning off, wander around in blustery London with my friend, I feel like I just hatched from an egg, everything is so bright and windy

Ah. Complaint was resolved within the hour, they're sending me a bit of compensation money, my old account is refunded, nonsense reading apparently fixed. Very friendly and helpful, so, all good at last I think?
@zumojuice @tiger_tea Yeah, that's a thing.
@Lycomorpha Good morning, this is beautiful
E.on customer service has been reliably friendly, only... Every time it turned out whatever they did had not worked, and the next time I phoned another friendly person said "oh that's weird".
Ah. They're on it now. Hopefully it'll get resolved soon. - I'm surprised how many friends are telling me they switched to Bulb, had not even heard of them.
@tiger_tea They're not free on books any more?
@flo_illustrator It really was, I literally missed deadlines and had to put in night shifts. So much time in the waiting loop, then endless repeated discussions with them being baffled that their system keeps playing up...
@EONhelp Apparently the account was "stuck" somehow. So I would like to have my account balance sorted out and not pay you any more while I'm in credit, and make sure that I only pay for gas used since I moved in here. Thank you.
@EONhelp I sent them, and photos of the meter reading on moving in and now.
I've also not received the credit back from the other account which I closed a month ago, even though I was told on the phone that it was £200+ in credit. Instead another direct debit went out.
@flo_illustrator Good. I hope this will be settled soon as I spent hours on the phone with them all month...
@EmmaIllustrate Yeah, I think I'm going to.
@FlorianVltmn Really good for the sleeping though
@FlorianVltmn I think if you go back you'd probably get younger and then going forward olderagain but your thoughts and perception would also rewind so you'd feel like you're doing the same time three times?
Hey they messed it up again. It's amazing. Maybe don't use e.on is my impression so far
@FlorianVltmn Do you rewind yourself or double over and exist twice for a bit?
@FlorianVltmn Just resleep
@FlorianVltmn Exactly
@FlorianVltmn Get an extra day to sleep.

Aubergine and chocolate ice cream is VERY GOOD

What have I sinned against the gods of admin, all I want is to make books and pay the bills. These last few months have been ridiculous.
This is the second time that I move to a new house and e.on serves me a huge bill for energy I can't possibly have used in the first month. At least this time I can prove it.
Can't believe the first thing I got to do after a month of trying to get e.on to switch my account to my new address is to raise a complaint because their meter readings are nonsense. I'm tired.

@EONhelp Hello. I just switched my account to a new address, which took over a month, me spending hours on the phone due to problems with your system. Now you finally managed to get it done - and the move in meter reading is impossibly high.
I wish to make a complaint.
@DaveShelton It's a bit frightening tbh
@DaveShelton They should. But they just seem to hear "I don't think I look good in this" when I tell them. They just don't care.
You can't be body positive for other people that way, folks.
And I don't even care who sees me butt naked. At all. I just care when people tell me that I should. Ick.
This tweet brought to you by me throwing away more trousers I had forgotten about
Sheesh

@Gallantdesigner Thanks.
Like... This started when I was maybe sixteen and it just has not stopped. I've thrown so many super tight trousers away that friends have given me.
@nesswaters Thanks.
@DaveShelton Okay thought so. I just... Yeah I think I'll step it up. Although so far no level of telling people how icky this is has made any difference.
It icks me out so much! I mean, I know it's wrong already, but is it a normal common everyday wrong thing people keep doing to people or do I have a special friend curse
Okay... Is it a normal recurring experience to have people who you are not in a sexy relationship with tell you vehemently to wear skin tight trousers, even if it makes you uncomfortable, or do I just have creepy people in my life?
Think of the stuff we could make if we were rested and secure... Hey hey anyway these books in making are really good and I love them. Just wish I could also spend some time working out what to do with the rash on my face for example
Hooray for London being so exhausting that everyone is moving deadlines all the time to catch up with stuff that hits the fan
Don't stop giving me work anyway because this will suddenly end when all deadlines come in simultaneously. Hooray for publishing moving deadlines about

Not as good as a whole lot of sauerkraut cooked with apple juice, beer and fat though. Nothing is that good
I've started to cook sautéed lettuce with a dash of orange juice, seasoned with caraway, as a side dish. It's good
I have a craving for sauerkraut and mash. I mean, ideally duck roasted on a casserole of beer-seasoned Kraut and potatoes, but I don't feel like it's time to eat meat again already.
@70s_party Plus, Liz is right, a normal fork will get clogged with raw sauerkraut. Two tines are the way to go.
@70s_party I mean... It's a completely normal dish? If you add some fruit to sauerkraut and cook it it'll turn mellow, and go perfectly with meat and potatoes. Mmm
@70s_party That sounds delicious and I want some

Workshop in progress again. https://t.co/obwIPafrDJ https://t.co/0My0kJWT0R
Look after yourselves, my friends 💚
Panic attacks (for example) are not a sign of low self esteem. And thinking of them this way will lead straight to depression, confusion, shame and massive anxiety.
And that would been really useful for me to know years ago. So, there you go.
It's easy, I just need a few minutes of quiet after ninety minutes of workshop, then I can go teach again... Half of the day. That's all.
The actual problem was that I was doing several workshops in a row and didn't get any rest, and after the last one I'd go away, relax and have a seizure or at least a massive panic attack.
Thinking of all the years before I had a diagnosis where when I said I find workshops hard people said "don't put yourself down, you are good at it, and you seem to be having fun, it's just low self esteem"
They all said "thank you" quietly in the end. 💚
Ah, today was finally the dreaded day that I had to warn the class I was teaching to not all talk at once because I might have a sensory overload seizure, and... They were perfectly used to that kind of thing anyway, and understood. So great.

@ComicPrintingUK I threw away all my notes about it, it was too beautiful to listen to and knowing that it was an advert and a cultural front for actual mass murder.
(see also why is viv so grumpy and won't go to steam punk parties)
@ComicPrintingUK Yeah, that one was... Hmm... We had gone to listen to some very strange beautiful music based on natural growth patterns and... it was all rooted in that. I thought it was my favourite thing I'd ever heard, and BAM
@ComicPrintingUK Also, all of twitter
@ComicPrintingUK Might be one of those things where you just notice more and more. I get really bothered by Ernst Haeckel colouring books since my biologist uncle pointed out the politics of racial purity behind all that beautiful symmetry
@ComicPrintingUK Hi, Radio alarm sibling
I guess what I'm saying is, think about people's writing (or drawing) rules and try them, but also look at who they are, what their voice is, whether their work speaks to you, what other kind of work speaks to you... Stylistic rules are never objective.
Also to be fair if someone does this I know I won't want to read the rest.

See, now I'm being mean. I think if you ask an author for rules they will remember all the writing they didn't really want to read as if it was a returning unwanted house guest...
I guess "don't introduce characters by making their first line a quote from a book or show you like". At least that's just the beginning, it is always a good idea to try changing the beginning around in any case.
I have some rules of writing in my head but I think if I'd list them it would just be sad for people who like that kind of thing that I really don't

They really don't respect invisible lane swimmers
We had a good discussion about what swimming style skeletons have and agreed that they would just sink to the bottom then crawl along, break up and move around independently until they had enough and reassemble to come back out of the pool

Is only it was in the interest of big companies to keep existing with the rest of us, they could work with the governments which represent people probably wanting humanity to keep existing to create transparency and sustainability
Yeah I'm awake https://t.co/VTFmH8Fhx6 https://t.co/gm5d2MTnqY
Yes, support sustainable farming, boycotting particular crops entirely first supports other unsustainable crops because unsustainable is always cheapest. We need more transparency for that, overall.
Seriously is it just me or do other people sometimes accidentally switch into animal noises/nonsense words when they're tired out?
There is nothing like being at a social event and accidentally replying to "so what do you do" with "MOOOOOOOOO... sorry I said moo I have to go now"
And that exchange feels monumental and I quietly desperately hope no one else talks to me because I might just accidentally reply with an animal noise or a song.
When I walk out into the real world after that, all I can do is perhaps buy a bath bomb and smile at the sales person and say "I have to leave now I'm allergic to soap, except for this bath bomb which is OK" and then stride away in an uncoordinated manner
Seems totally possible to blow all my communication skills in twice seventy minutes of teaching a day. Talking to thirty kids, explaining how to do something simple but specific, introducing some specific clear concepts, modelling how to interrogate a fictional scene
Then I go home, build myself a nest of familiar things and catch up with illustration jobs and watch movies but don't understand the plot.
I just look at people and notice that they seem sad or happy but forget to react to that, and I just reply either with something really literal or something unconnected about my own work
I'm good at workshops but while I'm doing workshops the rest of the day is a write off socially. I literally forget how to have a conversation and go back to my baseline, which is "autistic without masking skills".

Anyway, more workshops tomorrow.
She totally hunted down that deer though didn't she, we all know it
Mundane and seemingly nonsensical scenes can grow, change, resolve into meaning that way.
Anyway, here's a thing about weird made up scenes. Even if it's just a  fight between monsters (and it often is) the interesting question is, who is this book about, who does it begin and end with? What happens on the next page?
That's often where the story turns it to be.
Hello, I'm Viv Schwarz, I'm here to show you how I make stories so you can try it out, kids 
*cue howling reindeer pursued by sword wielding giant mother*
"Would you want to turn the page and see what happens next?"
"YES!!!"
The howling deer, unable to explain its affection, howls, escaping from the sword wielding mother. The child, helpless, unheard, protests. The jagged trees fill the page.
I love this workshop
Yeah, that's a scene, next one
"No, mother!"
The children raised their hands.
"The deer is friends with the child, but the mother thought it would eat it."
I contemplated the scene.
"Maybe the child should be saying something."
"The Mother Giant was chasing the howling deer through the forest".
I paused at that point, and said "Why though?"
Its body is composed of rectangles, its mouth is a circle.
It has antlers, and four busy legs.
Behind him, a large figure runs, a sword in her outstretched arm, reaching. She is dragging a smaller stick figure behind.
In the last workshop today we created a scene from characters the kids drew from shapes, and I think I'll describe it for you.
The scene is a forest of hastily scribbled pine trees, looming.
An animal is running through it.
🤐Go watch

@MartinHHBrown @Booktrust That's "Belletristik" in German, although I think traditionally that also included popular science.
I used to think that means "beautiful boredom" but I was wrong, would've been good though
These tweets brought to you by yet frustration about having a lovely quiet evening and my drawing hand is a total paw, and all day it was fine but I had to do phone calls and errands instead. ARGH
It's like... I need that brain for the drawing, please can you not fill it with having to worry about complex social interactions and noise
Seriously what is it though with people who tell you when to draw, when to stop drawing, what to draw, how to draw, and say "it's so easy for you to draw" and then ask you to draw them a logo for their new idea but not now but NOW but not now
How do any of you ever get any drawing done EVER
Or... Ugh! Or you're at a gathering and just found that balance of listening to the conversations and drawing something that's been on your mind and just needed a bit of background noise to surface... And it's "oh sorry that we bore you, by all means you can ignore us, right"
Probably you've just drawn for five minutes and someone goes "come on, you work too much"
Also... You know that thing when you actually finally get into drawing and somehow the whole world just keeps trying to stop you? All the phone calls, visitors turn up an hour early or unannounced, the cat starts crying
I get stressed out every time that I have spare time and I'm not drawing. That can't be good. It feels hard to explain to people who don't draw a lot. Either they don't get why anyone wouldn't draw all the time when they can draw, or they don't get being unable to concentrate.
I want to draw more stuff but my hands feel like paws after trudging truth that hail and... It's quite late. I think it's okay not to.

@Booktrust Fact books seems very similar, although I miss the thingness in it. Those books, after all, may contain any amount of subjectivity.

Couldn't find the swatches I made for this project with notes on which dyes I picked for it, was just going to go through the whole box to find out, then decided to try the ones with the most pleasing names first
I know myself

Off to pick up postal tubes for all the art I sold in the last few days, thank you
It really is good and funny and kind.
Was just putting Doctor Who on while sorting though my inks for a project, ended up just sitting there crying. Oof.
Sold this one. Always worth checking whether I'll put a thing in the shop if you really like it...

@kurai Yes!
I changed my mind, I'll eat a few more potatoes THEN nap
Now I actually need a nap. That was a pound of potatoes.
Oh gosh. I'm feeling in love with myself because I bought a bag of fine salad potatoes instead of the usual cheapest ones, and I billed the whole bag and ate half of them with cabbage. It was so nice.
This was two years ago and nothing has changed there https://t.co/J0gITF8xml https://t.co/EC9drpEjdn
