@kamran_fareedi @UWEair @ChazNuttycombe I helped Stover call for an open primary. By establishment, I mean in the sense of her policies and her background. In terms of the primary, though a lot of people were upset at her for pushing for right around the time of the general election last year.
@kamran_fareedi @UWEair @ChazNuttycombe You‚Äôd be surprised about the power of the Washington Post endorsement though. I think a lot of the voters who aren‚Äôt paying really attention will use that as a guide.
@kamran_fareedi @UWEair @ChazNuttycombe Stover also looks like an establishment pick too. I honestly think Wexton is the candidate to beat. I think the challengers are going to split the vote with one another.
@Robko85 @SenSanders @NomikiKonst @jjz1600 Why do you say that?
@kamran_fareedi @UWEair @ChazNuttycombe I think this will be a high turnout for a primary. Higher than last year‚Äôs primary. Low turnout would actually benefit Wexton. That‚Äôs why some of her supporters were trying to prevent a primary from happening.
@ChazNuttycombe @UWEair No. She lives in McLean. Outside Wexton‚Äôs Senate district.
@UWEair @ChazNuttycombe I live in the district. I don‚Äôt think she will. I think she‚Äôll place a strong second. Wexton is probably going to win Loudoun by a wide margin. Stover‚Äôs efforts west of Leesburg and the mountains won‚Äôt be enough. Stover will split the vote with the other challengers.

@robertcaruso @smartflexin It‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt trust Bernie at all. I could tell there was something wrong with his campaign in the fall of 2015. I was coming across these older white guys and wealthy young bohemians who struck me as right wingers lecturing me on the benefits of socialism. It was very odd.
@robertcaruso I don‚Äôt know her in particular. But yeah, people like H.A. Goodman.
@robertcaruso @smartflexin I think a lot of the problem with the far left in my experience is that they are privileged bohemians. So they have the appearance of being the type and background of people who support left wing causes. They‚Äôre really people though, who can afford to be purists.
This doesn‚Äôt surprise me at all. I‚Äôve been a liberal most of my life but alive had difficulty explaining what I didn‚Äôt trust about a lot of right wingers and libertarians.

@smartflexin @robertcaruso That‚Äôs a pretty apt description. I think it could also be described as a dichotomy between authoritarian vs. more liberal/libertarian tendencies.

@lisa_hollenbach @SallyAlbright You might think I‚Äôm stupid but I have a good knowledge of politics and I support @KamalaHarris Don‚Äôt write him off.
@SallyAlbright @sarahfdavis280 He will run again. And he will savagely attack candidates like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker.
@sarahfdavis280 @SallyAlbright Laugh all you want to but that sack of shit could be the Democratic nominee
@MacMargi @SallyAlbright I‚Äôm not a Bernie supporter. I didn‚Äôt support him in 2016 at all. I was an HRC supporter. I think he could easily win Iowa and New Hampshire easily making a clear path to the nomination for him. I don‚Äôt like the motherfucker and I‚Äôm very left wing.

Attacking him for cancelling for a legitimate reason is ad hominem. https://t.co/a6LB6rnTdi
@JVP409 @secupp She thinks she‚Äôs clever.
He stated that she ‚Äúcalled him out on his show‚Äù which she had no reason to do since he legitimately canceled. You retweeted his statement and agreed that he legitimately cancelled. https://t.co/a6LB6rnTdi
@secupp @marthamaccallum Ummmm...he had a legitimate excuse to cancel which you admitted and she is the one making ad hominem attacks against him.

@joe_hernandez89 @johncusack No but it gives us moral high ground. The Obama were a non-consenting party to this weird fucking shit.
@bsbd2511 @johncusack Conservatives would still love it but it would give those who oppose Trump righteous anger.
Maybe it‚Äôs just me but I‚Äôm just sick of dumbass liberals giggling about ‚Äúpee pee tapes‚Äù like middle schoolers. Most don‚Äôt get the context. So what if Trump has women pee on him? If he had them piss on a bed shared by the Obama‚Äôs he‚Äôs a fucking piece of shit. https://t.co/b60hVS7vF6
@johncusack Here‚Äôs the issue Cusack. Suppose he hired them to piss on him. It‚Äôs gross but it‚Äôs submissive &amp; conservatives would bash libs for kink shaming or whatever. If he pissed on them it‚Äôs legal and Trumpers would still love it. Hiring them to piss on the Obamas‚Äô bed is infuriating.

I am not endorsing the Electoral College. But even if the Presidency had been strictly decided by popular vote in 2016, there is no way anyone could say with certainty that Sanders would have won had he been the Democratic nominee. https://t.co/nt1smT8OE5
I think that is true. However, the fact that he was most popular candidate leading into 2016 doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean he would have defeated Trump or any other Republican candidate that November. https://t.co/GGfZxuyNDt
Okay if you‚Äôre not talking about polls, then what metric are you using to measure ‚Äúpopularity?‚Äù https://t.co/YSUsJz9ARv
@Sam__Bordeaux @curmudgeon_girl The person with the most wins the election. I mean you could say that that person was the ‚Äúmost popular‚Äù candidate on the day of the election. But someone being the most popular candidate months before an election takes place, doesn‚Äôt mean he or she will win that election.
@curmudgeon_girl @Sam__Bordeaux I wasn‚Äôt arguing with you. I was using your post to explain to @Sam__Bordeaux that polling is not necessarily an indication that someone will win an election.
@curmudgeon_girl @Sam__Bordeaux Even assuming the Presidency was strictly decided by popular vote and the counting was completely fair and accurate, there is no guarantee that someone who is ahead in the polls will win the election.
@Sam__Bordeaux There is a saying that the only poll that matters is the one taken on Election Day.
@Sam__Bordeaux Yes but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean someone will win an election because they are popular at one point in time before the election.

So apparently, I‚Äôve got some leftist English asshole going off on me for using Esquire as part of my Twitter handle. He‚Äôs saying that you have to earn the title out based on social class. In the U.S., you earn the title upon being admitted to the bar.
@MichaelGamache @gumbo_goddess This is according to one attorney out of Texas. I know a lot of attorneys here in the U.S. who use the title Esquire. You have to earn the title here unlike in England where it‚Äôs based on weird notions of social class.
@Delavegalaw This has been a problem in responding to RWers who insist Trump has committed no crime otherwise ‚Äúevidence‚Äù against him would have been found already. It just occurred to me yesterday one of the reasons Mueller has been biding his time is bc Trump will try and pardon himself.
Ummm, you actually have to earn this title in the United States. Once someone passes the bar here, he or she can use the title. This is not fucking England where titles are given out based on heredity or some warped notions of ‚Äúsocial standing‚Äù https://t.co/0UWGtxK57R
@Sam__Bordeaux @HongPong @alissakmclean @johncusack First of all, I‚Äôm not a centrist. Secondly, your argument makes a huge assumption that moderates will vote your candidates.
@Sam__Bordeaux @johncusack So what? That wouldn‚Äôt have necessarily translated into a a victory in the general election for him.
@AnnabelleHawk2 @MichaelGamache @johncusack Do you have any idea what it means?
It‚Äôs a professional title for people who are lawyers.
So it‚Äôs classless for me to use a professional title after my name but it‚Äôs perfectly fine for Jill Stein to call herself Dr. Jill Stein?
@AnnabelleHawk2 @MichaelGamache @johncusack Ummm, there are a lot of people who use the title Esquire.
@oattmweens @alissakmclean @johncusack I‚Äôm not sure what your point is here. Those jobs aren‚Äôt coming back to WV and they shouldn‚Äôt. Plus most coal miners now are pretty much Republican voters.
@oattmweens @alissakmclean @johncusack You obviously haven‚Äôt been to WV in a while or you don‚Äôt understand WV politics.
@oattmweens Obviously you think you know best how WOC should vote.
@oattmweens @alissakmclean @johncusack If you think it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre not far enough to the Left, you obviously don‚Äôt understand WV politics.
@oattmweens But they would also be voting against their self interest by voting for a candidate who is not electable.
@oattmweens @alissakmclean @johncusack Doesn‚Äôt ever work? Are you serious? A left wing candidate will not win in West Virginia. And it‚Äôs idiotic to assume that left wing candidates are always going to better than moderate candidates in general elections.
@MichaelGamache @johncusack Who the fuck asked you for your opinion?
@oattmweens @alissakmclean @johncusack You‚Äôre saying that the community should choose a candidate that, in your opinion, would improve their lives over the least bad candidate. Did it ever occur to you that WOC may be voting strategically for candidates they think have a better chance of winning general elections?
@oattmweens @alissakmclean @johncusack And you don‚Äôt think the Far Left is trying to force Sanders or other left wing candidates on the Democrats because they assume that WOC will vote for whoever is the Dem nominee?
@bbenack00 @johncusack I‚Äôm talking a lot of Sanders like candidates. They‚Äôre not the best fit in certain of the nation.
@oattmweens @alissakmclean @johncusack And you have a very paternalistic attitude. You‚Äôre essentially saying how you think WOC should vote.
@oattmweens @alissakmclean @johncusack I think you‚Äôve got it backwards. I think it‚Äôs racist to say people like Nina Turner represent the views of all black women.
@oattmweens @alissakmclean @johncusack Wow. Do you realize how you sound? I think she‚Äôs talking about a large majority of WOC. And you think it‚Äôs racist to pay attention to them?
@geeman215 @johncusack I wouldn‚Äôt call him a ‚ÄúLimousine Liberal.‚Äù That‚Äôs more descriptive of someone like John Kerry.

@HongPong @alissakmclean @johncusack It has nothing to do with going to far left in the 16 primaries. I think people just weren‚Äôt motivated enough. People on the left of center have just been too apathetic to vote in non-presidential elections.
I don‚Äôt blame Bernie for losing the key swing states. I definitely think there were shenanigans from the Russians and the Republicans going on on in the Rust Belt, NC, and Florida.

@r2no2 @tribelaw @AGSchneiderman Right. But he committed these alleged crimes this law would be passed.
@johncusack Impeachment does no good without removal. There is no way there will be at least 11 or so Republican senators who will vote for removal.
@tribelaw @AGSchneiderman Professor Tribe, if such a law is passed do you think Trump‚Äôs attorneys could argue that it‚Äôs an ex post facto law as applied to him and people like Michael Cohen?
@girlsreallyrule It‚Äôs not always money and there may be some money but it‚Äôs off the books.
@Delavegalaw It just occurred to me how to respond to the right wingers who blather about Mueller not having found anything yet and this is a worthless investigation. As soon as Mueller indicts him, Trump is just going to pardon himself.

@paix120 @sassydemasi as a former Catholic you should read this thread.
@paix120 Not to sound sarcastic, but would that mean he would be in outer space? The BBC documentary, I posted said he went to Kashmir which is near Mt. Everest.
@paix120 But if he is the Jewish Messiah, that would mean he is still physically alive today, wouldn‚Äôt it?
@paix120 Yes because they would be descendants of King David. The Jewish Messiah descends from King David and is supposedly a physically immortal human being.
@paix120 True. But here‚Äôs my issue. I‚Äôm not sure what Christians believe when they about one being resurrected. I think they mean bodily resurrection, not souls. If Jesus was resurrected, was it his body or was it just his soul that left the tomb?
@paix120 Yes but it was the first or the second temple that cracked?
@paix120 Jesus and his apostles were healers though. And they may have been anointing him as King but if it‚Äôs true that he had a relationship with Mary Magdalene, one of their descendants could be the Jewish Messiah.
@paix120 So are you saying that Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were anointing him in the tomb?
@paix120 I‚Äôd be interested to see if there were any Talmud sources. A lot of the people trying to debunk ‚Äúswoon theory‚Äù are right wing Christian sites.

@paix120 It is absolutely miraculous either way you look at it. And as an atheist, that‚Äôs why I respect his message and get angry at people who deny his existence. People who are considered saints performed miraculous things but they were still human beings.
@paix120 That was to convince people he was dead. It still might not have killed him. Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus brought myrrh and aloes to his tomb. Myrrh and aloes were used for healing, not for embalming someone.
https://t.co/7fJaohgjRQ
@paix120 I‚Äôve never seen that miniseries. I saw a great BBC documentary explaining according to modern standards, Jesus didn‚Äôt actually die by crucifixion bc his followers took him down in time. It would explain to me why a lot of non-Christians believe he existed but wasn‚Äôt the Messiah.
@paix120 They are righteous outbursts and I agree that he was for the most part peaceful but he was just like all other human beings and may have had violent impulses at times, especially in response to injustices.
@paix120 That‚Äôs a great explanation. I‚Äôm not a Christian myself even though I grew up Methodist. I‚Äôm an atheist. I took a course on Jewish law in law school from a Jewish professor. I see him more as a peaceful escaped convict kind of Andy Dufresne in the Shawshank Redemption.
@paix120 I get that but wasn‚Äôt it still an act of violence? I think I might be missing something here.
@paix120 Gun control measures are already racist anyway because they prohibit people with felonies and certain misdemeanors from ever purchasing one. Further gun control measures won‚Äôt be any more racist. It will actually make it more difficult for whites to obtain them now.
@IBJIYONGI They are also not allowed to own guns. It‚Äôs extremely difficult to get back one‚Äôs gun rights once you‚Äôve been convicted of a felony.

@RealFacelessMan @instapundit There are a lot of other issues at stake (e.g abortion rights, not lowering minimum wage)
Maybe he would be a moderate R in those other states but he is far better than Moore on a lot of issues. You‚Äôre taking away a vote from the Republicans on most issues.
@RealFacelessMan @instapundit Taking this seat away from Republicans makes it even harder for them to accomplish other things on their right wing agenda.
@RealFacelessMan @instapundit Again, it takes one vote away from the Republicans. Those aren‚Äôt winning issues in Alabama If it weren‚Äôt those issues, you would find some other issue. to make sure he wasn‚Äôt elected.
@RealFacelessMan @instapundit Jones is not opposed to all left wing goals. Also, you‚Äôre just making it easier for right wing Republicans to keep a majority in the Senate and to build upon it. You honestly can‚Äôt believe that a far left candidate can‚Äôt win in Alabama.

@TheRichWilkins @TomPerez 1. I still believe there was vote tampering. You can say I‚Äôm in denial or whatever. But I was never a big fan of hers in the first place.
@TheRichWilkins @TomPerez I think the most pressing thing right now is taking back the House in 2018 and keeping the GOP from taking control of 37 state legislatures.

@SteveInRealife @GinRocks77 @SarahKSilverman Liberal calls for gun control are just dismissed. It furthers the conservative agenda bc if they knock it down again it‚Äôs another victory.
@SteveInRealife @GinRocks77 @SarahKSilverman Nah. These were right wing websites like 4Chan.
@SteveInRealife @GinRocks77 @SarahKSilverman Also there were far-right websites trying to sow chaos and confusion the night of the shooting by spreading disinfo.
@SteveInRealife @GinRocks77 @SarahKSilverman My fear is that mental illness is being used as a scapegoat for a hidden political agenda.
@SteveInRealife @GinRocks77 @SarahKSilverman No it doesn‚Äôt. But could‚Äôve been that demo to make it look like it was ‚Äúliberal/leftist hatred‚Äù of ‚Äúgood ole fashioned Americans‚Äù
@SteveInRealife @GinRocks77 @SarahKSilverman I don‚Äôt think religious zealotry is a mental illness. It may be a cause of mental illness. May explain why SZs have religious delusions.
@SteveInRealife @GinRocks77 @SarahKSilverman 2) He also stockpiled weapons which is characteristic of anti-government types.
@SteveInRealife @GinRocks77 @SarahKSilverman 1) IMO, there is evidence he could have had extreme views even though he was non-affiliated. He didn‚Äôt live far from the Bundy Ranch
@SteveInRealife @GinRocks77 @SarahKSilverman But you‚Äôre sure this guy had a mental illness and was not someone with extremist political views?
@SteveInRealife @GinRocks77 @SarahKSilverman So would you describe most suicide bombers as mentally ill?
@SteveInRealife @GinRocks77 @SarahKSilverman Would you describe a serial killer like Jeffrey Dahmer or Ted Bundy as being manic?
@SteveInRealife @GinRocks77 @SarahKSilverman Wow. Okay. You may be a mental health counselor but way to dismiss my own experience with manic episodes.
@SteveInRealife @GinRocks77 @SarahKSilverman This act was calculated and thought out in advance. It took a lot of planning. I don‚Äôt think this could be from a manic episode.
@SteveInRealife @GinRocks77 @SarahKSilverman An act like this requires too much planning and coordination from the manic episodes I‚Äôve experienced.
@SteveInRealife @GinRocks77 @SarahKSilverman I‚Äôm schizoaffective. I‚Äôve had periods of mania. My motor skills and my thoughts were too impaired to do something of this nature.

@FiliaultFrance @jawillie @joanwalsh Ummm no. They were supporting Bernie to take out Hillary and we're going to vote against him in the general.
@FiliaultFrance @jawillie @joanwalsh A lot of Bernie's "supporters" during the primaries were Johnson and Stein supporters.
@jawillie @joanwalsh He still wouldn't have won bc many "Bernie supporters" were actually Stein and even Johnson supporters who would've pulled the rug out

@SallyAlbright Only privileged people can afford to risk Progressive era reforms and the New Deal (e.g. child labor &amp; min wage laws) for unrealistic goals.
@SallyAlbright A moderate Dem majority is better than an R filibuster proof majority that votes to get rid of the New Deal and Progressive Era reforms.
@SallyAlbright Most Berners have no clue what it takes to win a majority.

@kachristo I have encountered a few of them and usually they start throwing around the word privilege instead of discussing the issues.
@kachristo I hope you are aware that there are leftist POC trying to silence white people who disagree with them by labeling them as racist.
@peterdaou The thing that scares me the most is the Republicans have a real good chance of capturing a filibuster proof majority in the Senate in 2018
@treshaus @kachristo A lot of them want us to unite behind them and it pisses them that we won't blindly follow their lead.
@kachristo @treshaus Plus a lot of them have this condescending tone to them.
@kachristo @treshaus They think their experts on politics...it's going to be difficult to show them otherwise until someone like Bernie Sanders gets destroyed.
@SallyAlbright What's really maddening is how a lot of these people act like their experts on politics and campaigns and treated HRC supporters as ignorant
I really love how people who've never worked in politics or on campaigns have suddenly become experts on how politics really works.

@SallyAlbright Check out vote totals. It roughly = turnout. This appears to be raw count of caucusers after HRC supporters were forced to leave or vote BS
@SallyAlbright The worst are caucus states like KS and NE that report "popular vote" totals after the caucus is over which aren't in any way reflective.

@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne My point is that I think this was a pattern that occurred in a lot of states esp. the Rust Belt. IOW, ppl voted for him bc he was weaker.
@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne But 40% of his voters intended on voting Trump even if he were the nominee in WV.
@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne Obama had trouble in this area in the 08 primaries bc of conservative voters. I think these same ppl went Bernie in 16.
@JessikaJayne @WVforSENSANDERS FWIW, I support Kamala Harris in 2020. She's not nearly as strident and has a dynamic personality.
@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne Many of the people voting for him in those primaries were anti-Clinton votes similar to the primary in WV.
@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne He won them in the primaries...that doesn't necessarily translate into GE wins in those states.
@JessikaJayne @WVforSENSANDERS Yeah but at least she seems like actually cares. It's almost like you can tell Sarandon is faking it. No one can be that clueless and dense.
@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne And what makes you think he would have won the entire Rust Belt?
@JessikaJayne @WVforSENSANDERS People like Susan Sarandon don't give a flying fuck about ordinary people.
@JessikaJayne @WVforSENSANDERS That's what scared me the most. That many of the people who claimed to be his supporters were just faking and a lot of avg ppt got hurt.
@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne There were several polls that showed Dukakis with large leads at the time The point is you don't know what would have happened to Sanders.
@JessikaJayne @WVforSENSANDERS I saw Nader speak once and it reeled of indifference and privilege. I can't stand the faux working class demeanor that he and Bernie use.
@JessikaJayne @WVforSENSANDERS One of the big reasons I can't stand Berners is that many of them are privileged bohemian bourgeoisie who may secretly benefit from DJT.
@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne Those polls were from May. Dukakis had a 17 pt lead against Bush 41 in July 1988 and got blown out.
@JessikaJayne @WVforSENSANDERS I would have voted for him bc of the R Congress. I have too much too lose with Trump and the Rs being in office.
@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne I've worked on campaigns in Virginia. He would have been blown out in the exurbs and places on the I-81 corridor he needed to win.
@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne I think a lot of his supporters during the primary were simply anti-Clinton and would have voted Trump in the general.
@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne It would have put myself as well as POC in a tough spot. We would have been forced to support a candidate who was destined to lose.
@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne I would have voted for Sanders bc I would have had no other option. Unfortunately, a lot of moderates would have probably favored Trump.
@JessikaJayne @WVforSENSANDERS And they called southern voters most of which were black...Confederates.
@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne That's the problem I have with a lot of BERNERS...they assume that minorities and the rest of the Dem base will vote for him.
@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne You act as if there was something wrong in minorities voting for Clinton.
@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne Also the minority population is  heaviest in the Hampton Roads/Richmond area.
@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne I don't think he would have won Virginia in the general. He would have lost moderates.
@WVforSENSANDERS @JessikaJayne He got crushed in open primaries in places like Virginia.
@SallyAlbright I think this is a charade. It's like H.A. Goodman supporting Bernie.
@VanJones68 To hell with the Bernie or Bust Hamilton Electors.

@FindTruthUSA @lLedaga1971 @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse I'm not a student anymore. I graduated so yes I pay a decent amount in taxes. And yes it is wasteful spending.
@MrDane1982 Free college shouldn't be based on your parents ability to pay. I've known kids from wealthy families who get screwed by their parents.
@FindTruthUSA @lLedaga1971 @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Except I pay taxes for that BS while my student loan rates go through the roof.
@jslagra @MEUonamission @EvelynOConnor15 @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Yeah tell me how I'm winner when my student loan rates are about to go through the roof and when Trump wants to repeal the minimum wage.
@kachristo My money is on this having something to do with a dead hooker in an acid filled jacuzzi.

@sassydemasi Probably not but that's not what I was saying.

@sassydemasi Yeah you'd be surprised how many people in media have parents who were media figures as well. Like Luke Russert.
@jopcar115 No there are lots of us who despise Bernie bc many of his followers pushed many undeserving ppl in front of the Trump Train.
@AngryBlackLady These people are fucking assholes. They threw millions of people like myself in front of the Trump Train.
@SallyAlbright Bernie also can take as far left positions as he wants in Vermont without any fear.
@smalletravel @SallyAlbright The only problem is that Manchin may give them the 60th vote if they fall just short of getting that filibuster proof majority next year.
@JeffersonsNotes @c_barone @ezlusztig @jgrssi @peterdaou @maggieNYT Why would I waste my time with that washed up douchebag?

@TrueFactsStated I've suspected this for a while. I've seen quite a few on the Left who have been saying this for sometime now.
@AlexMohajer They definitely have been a party of obstruction but they actually have plans for much worse. I think this may only be a temporary setback.
@AlexMohajer Maybe. But the no votes were largely from right wingers in safe red districts who wanted more drastic changes than Paul Ryan's plan.
@jmrphy I definitely think there is a way to engage them. Many RW trolls are incredibly patronizing acting like as if they are your father.
@AlexMohajer The Iran nuclear deal. I think those factions are small and even then they care more about achieving their own political agenda here.
@AlexMohajer Do you honestly think Trump or the Republicans in Congress actually care?

@MCCindy64 No they do register with me. I DO NOT TRUST SANDERS BC HE JEOPARDIZES THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF PROGRESSIVES
@MCCindy64 Not everything against him was used. I watched it.
@MCCindy64 So was that just from California or all U.S.? There's a big difference.
@MCCindy64 No because I know so. I watched the Miami debate. And I've done my research. I love how you Berners assume ppl are ignorant.
@MCCindy64 When was this article released?
@MCCindy64 I'm not speculating. There other things out there. Like 1. He was deadbeat dad 2. He didn't vote until 40
3. On welfare as adult
@MCCindy64 1. Uh no, it's not. There is a lot of information on Sanders that wasn't used against him.
@Elkklr @joepauley @MrDane1982 If you think Kaine, is not progressive, you're an idiot.
@jayhill350 @joepauley No case not closed. You have to have corp. money to win now and she has to vote yes on Iraq.
@mdeloge @joepauley @SammySpeaksUp Because he wont win. It jeopardizes a lot of people's futures if he is nominated and loses.
@MCCindy64 They only know some vague details about some of his plans.
@MCCindy64 That's from last year and while some negative stuff that has been used, there is way way worse out there that hasn't.
I think you have that wrong. The Republican Party now is the same as the antebellum Democrats. There is a reason Trump honored A. Jackson. https://t.co/dZkj2LlALs
That's bc no opposition research has been used against him. Once that is shown, those numbers will drop significantly. https://t.co/ojHY0sf7fQ
@MCCindy64 @SallyAlbright @AngryBlackLady Do you have any polling data for that assertion?
@WinsteadDavid @raysr19 You assume he's being forced to say this stuff. He doesn't have to say anything. He says this on his own
@WinsteadDavid @raysr19 Uh no you didn't. It was quite the opposite and you were trying to make him admit Trump is a better person than him.
@WinsteadDavid @raysr19 That assumes that the entire opposition to Trump agrees upon strategy and tactics. We don't.
@WinsteadDavid @raysr19 I assumed it about you bc the manner in which you addressed Simon. I know Trump supporters who aren't nearly as bad.

@sassydemasi Even people who play #Pok√©monGo are more composed than this kid.
@now7grandkids What station?
@capricelroberts @RhodesCollege They can dream of making enough money to pay for college work for less than min wage in Trump casinos.
@capricelroberts @RhodesCollege They don't want the poor to have access to an education.

@mach5potato @JeffPassage @aigkenham Thanks. I've been on Twitter awhile and still am learning some of its finer nuances.
@mach5potato @JeffPassage @aigkenham Are you responding to me or Ken?
@GirlNamedBoston @aigkenham Or it's been mistranslated and misinterpreted.
@aigkenham You have a different interpretation of the Bible than Francis. The Bible could support this theory.
@aigkenham Evolution works like genealogy. Humans and other primates evolved from a common ancestor.
@aigkenham How are newborns conceived in sin? Is it because they were conceived via intercourse? If so, in vitro is immaculate conception.
@sassydemasi Yeah. You have to be concise in 146 characters.
@sassydemasi You get free labor out of people and perpetuate white supremacy. What don't you understand?
@WVUCavalier Not really if you look at their history of volunteer work and activism. Hillary just has a more pragmatic approach.
@sassydemasi In other words what I'm saying is there is a motive to throw people in prison.
@WVUCavalier Ummm, it explains why the incarceration rates are so high among blacks. Convictions are an end run around the 13th Amendment.
@I_Am_BigT @JordanPeele On a few but certainly not that many people.
The 13th Amendment doesn't apply when one is serving a penal sentence. https://t.co/FY229bmx7K
@amw781 @JoeBorelliCT2SD @JordanPeele It's slavery bc slavery is legal when one has been convicted of a crime.
@JoeBorelliCT2SD @JordanPeele That's bc the 13th Amendment doesn't apply when you've been convicted of a crime.
I think Bernie Sanders concern for the people of WV is like Christopher Hitchens description of Mother Teresa's concern for the poor.

@sassydemasi That's right bc I'm such a snob.
@sassydemasi That wasn't the point of me saying it. It was to draw a contrast.
@sassydemasi No you don't want to debate it bc it's a double standard. It's totally fine when B. Jones does it. Pretend there's no context.
@sassydemasi You could basically substitute UVA for Princeton in my encounters with ppl.
@sassydemasi I've lived in WV long enough to get the context. I've had the same kind of jokes made about me.
@sassydemasi So the people assuming it's a jab are the ones with the problem? Okay....

@CoolS509 @jemelehill Uh no. I thought she may have had the money to take an unpaid internship unlike most people.

@girlsreallyrule Another Berner from WV. I think these people may be secretly helping Trump.
Do you have any idea what you're talking about at all? https://t.co/1kuNK13e7Y
Nice racist and sexist assumptions there. What else would you expect from a so-called progressive that defends Trump and Putin. https://t.co/jckEURnTr7
The fact that Harris isn't progressive enough for you speaks volumes. https://t.co/KLVEVVu7DE
The fact that Warren isn't good enough for you tells me a lot. https://t.co/8FIqre7z0o
So..,you're saying those roughly 50K voters had no impact on the election? https://t.co/O1djelCaPq
@RemingtonONeill @MMFlint That's my fear I think MM and gang want to see the Rs get 60 Senate seats and 38 state legislatures.
@RemingtonONeill @MMFlint They won't and if he does win they will start purging the Party.
@MMFlint @moon15116 There are millions of us who support Perez.
@MikeNellis The last I saw was like at least a week out and he was only at 180.
@MikeNellis How recent is the AP count?
@MikeNellis What makes you think it will be Perez?
Except nothing will satisfy these people when they call progressives like Harris and Warren the same thing. https://t.co/WRnBvgYGZn
Here's a start. I think this was trend in many of the primaries and caucuses.
https://t.co/bq4ratdThW https://t.co/6WZFEBfg7D
@CapehartJ @SoundCloud He really needs to win today.
Many people who voted for him in the primaries actually supported Trump. https://t.co/S1I5D7sJt8
Good for him. That doesn't mean he would have won or will win the Presidency. https://t.co/S1I5D7sJt8
@cranstonl1972 I don't think this is a winning strategy.
https://t.co/l9UYUTgyzO
Ummm, I actually more progressive than many of the people who supported Sanders during the primaries. Many of them were just anti-HRC. https://t.co/MsIfODWhjt
The Sanders faction of the party thinks we should be doing more to appease these voters. https://t.co/kTKLGRp9B2
Free college is another. They label us as spoiled snowflakes who want a handout. https://t.co/3vnrd24S3H

@boni5d @peterdaou @TomPerez That's what a lot of the Ellison faction wants is to destroy the Party.
@imwithher61 @peterdaou @TomPerez It's going to be difficult to unite when one faction insists on doing things bc they want to lose.
@cdrtx @peterdaou @TomPerez The fact that's he's not a lightning rod.
@MaryAnnHijack @VABVOX @bannerite That's the point. They did it in western states and Libertarians posing as Berniecrats hijacked them.
@MaryAnnHijack @VABVOX @bannerite Republicans are forcing Dems in some states to switch to caucuses
@MaryAnnHijack @VABVOX @bannerite No if his supporters get control of the state parties.
@peterdaou Bannon definitely has a warped view of The Fourth Turning if you've read it and it's frightening what he intends on carrying out.
If anyone has read The Fourth Turning, Bannon definitely has a warped view of the book and it's frightening what he intends on carrying out. https://t.co/TwU0dCk01Y
@MaryAnnHijack @VABVOX @bannerite Exactly and I'm afraid they're going to do things like demand more caucus states and far left candidates.
@MaryAnnHijack @VABVOX @bannerite Ellison's supporters will feel empowered to drive the party off a cliff.
@heretical_1 @PalmerReport No they cannot. There is nothing in the Constitution that allows SCOTUS to do such a thing.

My point is he probably would have lost to a Republican if he hadn't shifted right. https://t.co/uhH5TZ5DHx

And I'm not treating you with respect here? https://t.co/wwkgX2Qixu
Not necessarily. There are a lot of RW independents. They vote left in the primaries bc they want a weak opponent in the general. https://t.co/DGW2emooVt
He pushed it right because the voters of the state have shifted right. He's a political opportunist. https://t.co/JGXqmXRrao

You know all 125K who voted for him. Exit polls said that about 50K of them were Trump supporters.
https://t.co/l2WO0tum8H https://t.co/MphkmHw77K
@StephenSkinner @realwvdems Also conservatives who are still registered as Democrats.
40% of Bernie voters were actually Trump supporters. That's a large amount. They voted for him bc they consider him the weaker GE candidate https://t.co/QbtnHsWYI5
@realwvdems He may give them votes on some issues but not all of them. It's better to have an ally in some areas than none at all.
@realwvdems I'm not sure even if they start early it will be enough. WV is too conservative both socially and economically now.
What purpose would it serve if a purer candidate lost the general? https://t.co/F5xlzbUIfd
Yeah but a "progressive" may not be able to win the general. https://t.co/xlV21NUbIJ

@sassydemasi Didn't say they weren't harmful. They are harmful just not nearly as bad.
@sassydemasi Because this wasn't about my personal. It was about stereotypes against white Appalachians not = to racial stereotypes.
@sassydemasi So tell me, have you ever used the term "redneck?"
@danibostick If you're alone, great excuse to change channel. It's worse than violent horror. Plenty of great college basketball on today.
@sassydemasi Also you never hear this used as a slur against racial minorities.
@sassydemasi Bc I've heard plenty of very privileged white WVians complain about this very thing but have no problem trashing poor whites.
@sassydemasi  My point wasn't that they were okay but they weren't on the same level as racial stereotypes. Not even close.
No I don't get how it's okay for ppl from places like Morgantown and Charleston to use it and then cry foul when someone else does. https://t.co/Kg2PjXAjFv
I've heard plenty of well off WVians use this as a slur against people from VA, KY, and NC but then cry foul when used against them. https://t.co/Sy4VwBZ3P9

Except Zlatimeyer probably never had them thrown at her like I have had them used against me. But apparently it's okay for WVians use them. https://t.co/vvcXvI8wxz
I'm not defending the use of Appalachian stereotypes but to compare them to racial slurs is pretty weak and offensive. https://t.co/i8ia5FRUJ2
