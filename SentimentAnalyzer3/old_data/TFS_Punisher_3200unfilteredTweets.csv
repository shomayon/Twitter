@Braddock512 @ThePollus Love it!  We have a shelf just for that!
@MLGProLawyer Yeah, it gives you that little box with an arrow if they have an open slot in their squad, but if the server is full, it disconnects instead of placing you in queue.
@Sllayt3r Done :)
@Sllayt3r Sure, I'd like to test it out.
@GeezusSpecials Exactly.
@Exopolitician @joshyboyles2 Big time.  It's desperately needed.
@MLGProLawyer If I click on a friend that has a squad slot that's in a match, 75% of the time, I get a server disconnect error and if they leave and join another, it won't pull me over unless I rejoin them once they're out of the previous server.
@joshyboyles2 @Exopolitician Good thing, the issues really aren't gamebreaking, just annoying AF.  Core gameplay is really good.
@Zerith0_RC I run with it on but I don't know what my render ahead limit is set to.
@joshyboyles2 @Exopolitician I'm referring to it in my video as a "game with good bones, that needs a lot of polish to get it up to speed."  A lot like BF3 was at launch.
@Zerith0_RC Cores are unparked.  Toggled FFR off and back on.  Only thing that fixed it was lowering settings.
XSplit now has NVENC encoding.
@Zerith0_RC CPU only, no RTX.  It was happening some in DX 12, but it was really bad in DX11.
@Zerith0_RC No, it was on every map I played and it was consistent.  Just a single spike that would freeze the game every 20 sec or so.
@striterax Oh yeah, another thing.  The squads being locked is frustrating.  Can we add a lock/unlock feature for the squad in the main UI so that when the squad joins a sever it's not defaulted to locked unless we want it to be.
@striterax Has Battlefield V's friend's list number been increased to match Origin?  In BF1, anyone that you added over your 100th friend would not show up on the in-game UI and joining them through Origin caused joining errors?  I believe this might be the case in BFV too.
@striterax Region locks on console.  Stop getting disconnect errors when you try to join the server your squad is in and just place you in queue.  Server info the squad is playing on displayed under the squad.,
Noticed that in full ultra in DX11 or 12, I was getting the occasional spike in CPU use causing stutter.  Turn settings to low and it went away.  Going to see if I can isolate the issue.  May be a single video setting causing it.
BF1:  Join game, play solo or rando squad.  BFV:  Look at friend's list to see who I can squad up with.  That shows how important it is to play with a good squad.

As a sneak peak, the worst thing about the game, to me, is the broken squad system.  It is an absolute mess.  It took 15 minutes of workarounds to finally get a squad in a server together yesterday.  It is unreal at how painful it is to play with friends currently.

@TheLankySoldier I'd like to see how it plays out once they make the tweaks they've said they were going to do before I bring out the pitchforks on DICE.
@TheLankySoldier Yeah, I'm basically the same, but I also see how it does benefit other areas, like keep teams from getting unbalanced and "tricking" people into thinking they have a chance to win.  I'm on the fence about the mechanic.
@JulianJanganoo With the new RTX, the NVENC is at a better quality than using x264 in fast preset, so you should be able to stream at 1080p/60 with about a 1% loss in overall performance.  Basically no FPS loss in game.  If you have SLOBS and you can use Quicksync, the same rule applies.
@peterthemaniac I try to be, but it's a struggle for me to be motivated about anything right now.  I have the best BF game I've ever played now for a week and I have no motivation to try and play it.
@PixelParadoxx Yep, I agree.
@NoZoupForYou_ It's the best gunplay I've seen in a Battlefield game.  It is near perfect to me.
@PixelParadoxx Yeah, sometimes the performance increase comes by way of increased average FPS, not max.
A few know this already, but I've been diagnosed with depression.  I have a good support group and I've begun a treatment program.  Just asking for a bit of understanding if I'm supposed to stream or have a video out and it doesn't happen.  More than likely, that's why.  &lt;3

@PixelParadoxx I have a Ryzen 7 1800x/1080Ti and it runs great, full ultra, 100 FPS, smooth as butter.
@PixelParadoxx Yep.  I put a video comparison out last night of pre-prepatch/post-patch DX 12 gameplay.
@PixelParadoxx I heard Shadow of Tomb Raider is pretty nasty with DX12.
@PixelParadoxx No.
@DANNYonPC You get a boost, but not as much as lower end users.  It definitely benefits older systems more.  For me, I'm seeing 15-20% increase in FPS, for lower-end users, they could see 30-40% maybe.
They've been doing this for years with console, hence why they can run the same games as PC and perform well considering what they have for processors.
Some may not get why DX12 is important, but it is the first Windows PC low-level API that allows devs better control of how processors process data for their games, thereby allowing them to better optimize their game TLDR; lower end CPU/GPU users get a nice performance increase.
@joshkumm @MrProWestie Not sure.  I'd refer to the roadmap.  It should tell you.
In case you weren't aware NVIDIA users..... https://t.co/qcJFdkftU2
@joshkumm @MrProWestie I think the first Tides of War installment will have dedicated Frontlines.
@The_1uan I'd like to see it too.
@p1anetmatt @SgtDangerCow Agreed.  It's too early and the reason why I said yesterday that I wish DICE would just leave the guns alone for a while.
@PixelParadoxx It was server dependent I believe.  Some I could revive, some I couldn't.  It seems to be fixed now though.
@SgtDangerCow That's my concern.  I believe people are being a bit strong in their opinions of it.
@MRLOADINGMAN Please explain.  I'm not going to be dogmatic about my opinion, so I'd like to hear what you think it requires to make it the best (I'm assuming RSP is coming BTW, so no need to mention that).
@SgtDangerCow Gotcha.  Yeah, it will, but honestly, I wish they'd leave it for a while.  Do you agree, there has to be a really strong gun for people to use?  I've been able to counter it with other guns.  I don't think it's absurdly strong.  It's a lot of fun though.
@SgtDangerCow I'm missing context.  Celt must have me blocked, lol.
@NoZoupForYou_ @tavantallaaja @DANNYonPC To achieve exactly what it did:  have tighter ending rounds.  If knew nothing of the mechanic prior to yesterday and I was blown away at how close the rounds were.  It was exciting.  That's what they were trying to do.  Problem is, now we know the mechanic is there.
@p1anetmatt @DANNYonPC But, I also think it takes away some of the reward of winning a close game, or more so, making a big comeback.  I'd rather know we pulled one off on our own, not with help.  It's better than a BS train or blimp though.
@p1anetmatt @DANNYonPC It's weird for me.  I don't like it in it's current condition.  But, I'm also open to seeing how it will work once they adjust it.  To me, I'm willing to allow it for the sake of keeping servers from dumping players if it's not as strong as it currently is.
So, knowing I haven't hardly touched medic (because of the revive bug), my favorite guns so far in BFV are the KE 7, Bren,  Sebslater 1916, Gewehr 43, STG, and the Model 8.  Could you imagine if the medic had the KE 7?  God, that would be fun.
@Gambit_BF @barho0om_mohd I prefer it.
@KeithPlaysPC @killyourfm thicc
@SeanC7011 It's amazing isn't it!  I haven't been this excited in a while about a Battlefield game.
For my video last night, I should have been a bit clearer.  DX 12 now works well with NVIDIA cards.  Seems AMD GPU users are still struggling.
@MrProWestie @TacticalTurtleY Exactly.  I haven't hardly touched medic because of that very thing.
@CatchMeStreamin @StoneMountain64 @Darkness429 @FacebookGaming You and @streamlabs get SLOBS and FB working, you can bet you'll have a BFV streamer on your platform.
@SeanC7011 I don't think so.
@barho0om_mohd Here's my thought.  In my mind,  BF3 offered the best "overall" gameplay experience, looking at core gameplay/maps/skill gap.  I believe BFV trumps that with how they've changed the gun mechanic/suppression and attrition.  Plus, it's freaking gorgeous and the audio is better.
@JulianJanganoo Yeah, AMD needs to put a driver out I imagine.
It's an interesting discussion.  Everyone was amazed at how close the CQ games were in BFV, including me.  It made for exciting and rewarding finishes.  Now, we know of the "Comeback Mechanic".  Has that changed your view of winning a CQ round now?
@wisNia6T https://t.co/u9j8dyvLqG
@barho0om_mohd Damn, I was hoping for some rage reaction.  Actually, I started playing at BF2 PC.
@Nnelly4808 @Iam_Curtis @MrProWestie They admitted yesterday it was a bit too strong.
@Nnelly4808 @Iam_Curtis @MrProWestie Not sure exactly the mechanic, but the losing team gets the ability to burn flags faster than the winning team.  Not sure if there's  a certain differential that is required before it triggers, but yeah.
@barho0om_mohd @MrProWestie BF1
@Iam_Curtis @MrProWestie I agree, but it's not gamebreaking.
@TacticalTurtleY DX12 and the reviving issues.
With yesterday's patch, DICE addressed two of the major concerns I had for #BattlefieldV.  The third is still up in the air, but I have to say, BFV can shape up to be the best Battlefield I have ever played.

@TheBullzeyeKK @DANNYonPC Oh, sorry.  Guess you're right.  You used to be able to type it.  Cap at 200 then.  My BFV was crashing so I disabled each command one by one until I found the one that was crashing the game.  Don't know why it crashes, just that it does.
@TheBullzeyeKK If you have 8 GB or less on your GPU run memory restriction on.  Other than that, it's common sense stuff.  Run low except mesh in ultra to maximize FPS.  Cap frames at 20 over your refresh rate.
@TheBullzeyeKK That's Jika's config from the beta to remove TAA.
Put a # in front of it to keep BFV from using it if you want to test it out for yourself.
This command is causing startup crashes in BFV if you have it in your user.cfg:  WorldRender.LightTileCsPathEnable 0
@MonkeyFacex323 @TheBullzeyeKK Not sure.
@SeanC7011 No, just update the latest NVIDIA driver, start the game, enable DX12 in advanced video settings, restart the game, and enjoy.  You can also enable it in the prof_save file, but I'd just use the UI.
@DoctorSparky83 When you turn it on, restart the game, it should then stay in DX12.
@SeanC7011 Yep, that's what it's there for.
Massive improvement with DX12 for me.  Much smoother.  Stuttered once in about 10 minutes.  Full ultra on Rotterdam and was between 100-120 FPS at 1080p.  I recorded it with performance graph for data, fyi.  Thanks DICE! #BattlefieldV

What I'd love to see if BFV is to be able to disable TAA or have another option.  I don't like the blurriness it causes and I think it's a major culprit for FPS loss.
@DANNYonPC LOL, yep.  That's how I'm looking at it too.
@DANNYonPC Yeah, too bad if you use RTX, because you're forced to use DX12.

I tried playing BFV in DX12 just for the memes last night for a few rounds.  DICE really needs to figure out why it stutters so badly.  Feel bad for you RTX peeps.
@jackfrags @TearGasJazz It's one of my favorites too.  I enjoy playing sniper with the Model 8 or assault with the Gewehr 43.  For as big as it is, the brush gives infantry good coverage and bridge battles can be epic!

@Grenadings Lol, blocked.
Also, can we ever expect DX12 to actually work correctly in BFV?  It amazes me that a game that can't run DX12 well at all, was used to promote RTX, a tech that requires DX12.
Do you feel BFV could've waited to get DX12, squad lobby system, and RSP squared away before going live?  There's some things about the game that has me head scratching.
Great freaking stream tonight!  Teamed up with @TexasVetTV and had a blast playing BFV!  Thanks for the follows and the great chat, I appreciate it!

BFV players, if you're using War Tapes and not 3D audio, keep doing so.  I'll enjoy my distinct advantage.  BFV 3D Audio+Audio Technica Sonic Pros is a match made in heaven.
@AmazinSuperHick There's some issues, but they've got this thing nice and tight.  The gameplay is verging on BF3 level for me.

@SeanC7011 The only one I'm not crazy about is Narvik.  Other than that, I've had a lot of fun.
Welcome to the fold new DICE Friends!
@KeithPlaysPC Yeah, but who's willing to run it with RTX if it stutters as badly as it does.  Not good at all.

So, what's everyone's favorite map so far?  Personally, I'm enjoying Devastation and the Twisted Steel.  #BattlefieldV
@AKA_ART_ Be strong Art.  Condolences bro.
@p1anetmatt @Chris177uk IDK, but it seems Frostbite hates it.
@Chris177uk It never has, and probably never will.
@KeithPlaysPC Then I do :)  It's on the stream PC.
With BFV running well on my PC, I'm almost afraid to update to the lastest NVIDIA drivers.

Liking the new mouse.  Really feels good.
@Big_Bubbaloola I like it.
@SteezeMcQueen1 @LugasGaming Medics can't revive, lol.  Everyone else can though.
So, BFV is pretty good.  :)
@sharkeyryan Regular too.
With that said, game play is freaking unreal.  The Prologue gets you in the feels.  Perfect @JFGnorD.
