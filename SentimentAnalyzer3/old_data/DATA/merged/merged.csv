And oops!! Put this in ur mind! Play a fool and let them think they fooling U, remember God is watching!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And oop remember Karma is a bitch!!! What goes around comes back around but u will not notice it, but willl go through the things u wants or someon u know in LIfe!!!! Remember every human has a spirit who look after them and who fight back! Remember u don’t walk freely in life!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And oops! Remember every pain u go through is just a blessing  to ur diff life!!! God doesn’t let innocent ppl die, it a wicked powerful devil who will destroy others life, God had not forgotten u,he is watching u and making a way out!! Rmber Holy Spirit everywhere watching!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Remember God did not give something power on earth to destroy others!! Remember the world is filled with hypocrites and very wicked ppl, listen to imagine me by Kirk Franklin, it will boost u up! Remember ur enemies are not GOd! If u die in life u come back for revenge in life!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don’t believe the lies they spit in ur ears, if that stupid girl is sooo powerful remember the devil gave birth to a daughter in the world, who became very powerful, remember no matter what u go through in life, there is a God and a way out!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Loook at me as example!!!  God said he knew me before I came to the World, now the same God watching me being tortured, now ask ur self??? Why will God let  the enemies destroy me, but it written in the bible,God make his children go through problems and struggle..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
De bible said don’t pray so loud in church like a hypocrite but pray in silents😏😏remember the devil has millions ears everywhere with his angels, and the louder u pray , the more the more  devil come closer to destroy u!!! Remember devil agents are searching for souls!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bible said test thy spirit and see whether it from God or not!!! Don’t let someone abuse ur right on earth just becuz u think it the devil!! The devil rule on earth but not above!!! There is  a man who will confuse the world that he is God, that is when u need to be careful!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Remember there is difference between God and gods!!! There is difference between Holy Spirit,  God the father and God the son!! The devil has no power on human unless God give him that power, the devil was cast on earth by God that same devil went to the pit by God!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If a stupid devil is torturing someone just becuz he sin😏than remember the devil wants that person since ages since he was born,God said I gave u power over demons and devils!!! Now seriously why will devil abuse someone right just becuz he sin? Is tortured and need to be ban!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Remember if the door of ur blessing is 🔒 locked😏🙄🙄🙄always use the bible as a example they all went through hell but came back with great blessings, remember nothing on earth in permanent, ur struggle might made u blesss someone or open someone eyes to see the work of God!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The word of God is ununderstandable,, remember no one in the bible had a great beginning 😏😏😏😏they alll pass through the gate of hell before becoming great with great blessings, 😏U can never understand the work of God!!! it might be a struggle but remember there is way out https://t.co/15PpCNhDLA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Example of Jesus!!!! He was born in flesh but die and came back in flesh!!! 😏😏he was tortured cuz of his gift, but came back great!!! But remember he was God son😏😏😏remember God knows what he doing!! He used ur enemies to make u great!! I said my enemies are not God..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Remember this he said my God my God why have u forsake me?? 😏😏but at end !!! He became great with great blessings 😏🤐God love is understandably, he open his heart to the ones who think there is no God, he test them but yet show them the way out!!! He said ur sins are forgiven.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@matty_lawrence And the bible said who are you to judge a fool!That same bible said Not everyone that called his name Jesus Jesus will go to heaven, but a fool a thief, a Murderer and a killer will enter in heaven only if they confess,  same bible Do not judge or u will be judge 😏😏😏😏😏,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@matty_lawrence And the fool who said there is no God was tested by God to see his glory 🤣was used by God🤣🤣The bible said come to me I will show u the way!!!

@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I fail to see how you think a choice is equal to killing the elderly. Involuntary euthanasia isn't a thing. That's just murder. But then the choice to be euthanised isn't there either so maybe you should think about that cause first?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Wait I thought you said an unborn foetus was a person too? Isn't that three? Sacarsm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their lives have not begun yet, they are unable to live outside the womb. And once Ireland is able to provide that care without judgment and to a sufficient level, then maybe your point is valid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Once again, we are not killing babies. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And frankly, before they have been born, the mother's life should still be more important. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The amount of kids in care is ludicrous, and the suicide rates in foster kids is high as hell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews There are already over 7.6 billion people in the world. There are finite resources on this planet. Don't try defending your cause with overpopulation of the planet. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also, I don't think you have the correct statistics to back up that claim.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Somehow I think all the kids in care, abused by their parents etc etc would beg to differ.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews So women deserve for their lives to be ruined by a child they did not want, cannot care for, is a product of abuse/rape, severely disabled, cannot afford, risks the mother's wellbeing long term or short term? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think most women would prefer the choice. They don't have to take it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@_HarriRose 😘😘😘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews We are going round in circles love. I would rather have the choice to terminate a pregnancy that I do not want, there are still rules in England with the option to abort. The moment you willingly put a unborn foetus before a living woman, you've condemned another life to misery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@MadHatterJimmy Yeah I'm planning on a Corsair keyboard. And yeah I use my laptop screen when streaming. Again this screen is borrowed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@MadHatterJimmy Lol god no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@MadHatterJimmy The headset was a present, the mouse is Grant's, I can't find mine 😢,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Whether it is likely or not those few women should be given the choice. And seeing as I live in England, where thankfully, abortion is legal, it really does not become an expectation. It's still a damn hard decision but give a woman a choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Intestines are developed outside the body and twist in. Definitely not all in place by then. There's no use in an undeveloped lung. It's like saying uncooked chicken is still suitable to eat. And what about protection from an abusive family due to being born of rape/force?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

@RuthMarieLand @Trish_Jones_ @BBCNews Two losses? I'm so sorry 💙 I'm glad you've been somewhere that does give you the option and care you need 💙,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews No one said about the delivery of an unborn baby... It would poison the mother if it wasn't removed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And so the mother, the VICTIM, should have to suffer instead?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I think you best read up a little more. Lungs and kidneys still need to develop through the entirety of the pregnancy. https://t.co/Wf2zVOopJM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Contraception isn't 100% effective. Therefore a couple trying their best to avoid pregnancy could end up with an unwanted pregnancy. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But you'll risk the well-being of a premature baby born at 23 weeks because it kicked? It doesn't have the organs to survive alone...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@RuthMarieLand @Trish_Jones_ @BBCNews I'm sorry you had to go through that. The right to a safe abortion should be available to every woman.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Thanks for informing me on how a human is created... But frankly a foetus cannot survive outside a womb until around 25 weeks. That is no life. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I suppose you're someone who believes contraception is wrong too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Yet women aren't all given help. You're not killing a baby... It's not alive until it is born, until then, it is a foetus. I fail to see how a child born from rape or into poverty wouldn't leave a 'trail of devestation' too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let women make their own choice about their bodies...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews What about a mother who was raped, or living in poverty, who's life is at risk through not having an abortion?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I'm not sure if you know the OP but she could have been at risk due to something wrong with the mother rather than the unborn. It happens so often. -_- since when did the rights of women men less than something that cannot survive on its own?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@miliszan Thank you sweet. I keep being relieved I'm not but sad I'm not 😂,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@xmako_eyesx That's true. I probably would end up collapsing and without Grant to help me and notice when I'm going I would probably freak a bunch of people out! 😂,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tho when my mum asked me if I was going I kinda felt sad. I haven't missed MCM May in years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But on the other hand, I wasn't even thinking about con until this week and I'm not as hyped for it as I once was.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HEY GUYS FYI I'VE TAKEN ART HISTORY AND BUDDHIST LITERATURE CLASSES AT UNI.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLEASE CLAP.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this concept of an imperfect, subjective," spontaneous expression isn't unique to eastern art. this idea was explored significantly in western art (notably abstract expressionism). you see it in Barnett Newman's ""zips"" and Jackson Pollock's overall method of painting. https://t.co/5pIUufvw0w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some examples of wabi-sabi in zen  ☸️🗾: https://t.co/zLGTaPTtnT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is a process of silencing the mind and thus removing the suffering of your own condition," removing the ""self"" and tapping into the insight that comes with detachment. but you are still just as human and must carry out the dharma for the rest of your mortal experience https://t.co/LlhKBSd7oD",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"zen buddhism also has a concept I really like known as ""wabi-sabi"". it is the embrace of the ephemeral nature of all things and the imperfections of the human experience. enlightenment doesn't mean you're suddenly infallible", you still proceed as a mortal being with flaws ☸️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you see this a lot in zen buddhism. there is an effort or lack thereof, to have this feeling of spontaneity and clarity within daily life. you see it with the way gongs resonate, or the intuitive, uninhibited creation of an ensō and in other rituals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is sort of the nature of the phenomenon of the epiphany. it is a momentary grasp of a lucid, revelatory, transcendent experience. but like all things, it is ephemeral. you wake up the next day, losing a part of it, proceeding as usual. suchness is about preserving that sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is only when we become attached to expectations or external conceptions that by nature limit us or make us smaller that we slip out of that enlightenment. In that sense it is something you can slip in and out of. If all we have is the present, you can be enlightened NOW 😉🌌,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I forgot which sect(s) it is but in some form of Buddhism ☸️ there is the idea that everyone -- by default -- is already a buddha, already enlightened. You can see this with children--what they lack in knowledge they make up for in spiritual unattachment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://t.co/u1ZyKQOBWY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you just see ""god"" as everything both within u and in relation to u as opposed to an omnipresent external judge this becomes a lot easier to process",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not that there was a specific person with a divine experience it's that we collectively chose to reinforce that idea and maintain it long enough over the course of history for it to be normalized.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Or idk that's just an idea. I mean think of how we give religious iconography strength and how faith and perceived cause-effect connections strengthen the impact of those religions.... 🤔,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If we live in a world of mental energy and symbols and internalization, maybe if there is enough of a proliferation of an idea (i.e. boomers dying from heart attacks) that is signified culturally, that will begin to manifest more physically. It's all about the strength of belief,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was in much more of a flow then so my transcendent subjective reality began to overlap more with the more mundane objective reality. It seems like whatever mass hysteria I sensed then had kind of died down a bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I gotta say my external reality certainly has changed significantly since I started posting again in Fall, especially during Winter, at least on the level of collective consciousness expansion or shifting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe I'll just continue to subversively divert the ontological norms enough until my external reality presents me with a system that doesn't feel so stacked against me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018: Hipster neurotypicals disregarding context for performative in-group brownie points and self-aggrandizement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people who are denoted as geniuses by contemporary society are often given that status after that person has already become successful via either business or academia. It's retroactive. Clout. A reflection of that person's perceived success. Completely different.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd say that capitalism doesn't reward genius, it rewards the byproduct of genius that is palatable enough for the masses or has appeal that doesn't require the same mind as the creator. Genius more often exists at the margins, in cramped middling apartments, psych wards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It also suggests that genius is a product of society or history and not of the mind of an individual. How society perceives or ranks a figure has nothing to do with that individual's objective ability. https://t.co/Dn7lmA0NYh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of these arguments are pulled out of thin air and poorly explained. Rubbish. No scientific or historical context whatsoever. Perfectly illustrates the myopia of the current culture. We've accelerated so much these clowns can't remember life before 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lol I'm just bullshitting. I just think it's a cool topic and we need more rugged individuals right now. shit sucks and eyes are on everyone, the internet's wild west days are long gone. Ideologies have been manufactured and adopted by didactic syndicates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which way Western man?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by no means is he fully disciplined or even a stable figure; he will imbibe, gamble, fornicate, perhaps even steal or murder. survival is the primary undercurrent in his being, and in a lawless society he will do anything to preserve it. and still a lingering desperation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in molding himself he sees no need to trust the hearsay of the commoners, and, with nothing to gain, finds no pleasure in their never-ending charades. a loner. satisfaction stems from the fruits of his labor, the weight of his presence, self-reliance, wisdom through experience,,,,,,,,,,,,
as an archetype, his individualism and self-preservation makes him an iconoclast. he sneers at the state, the creeping of corrupt hierarchy to the west. confident in his autonomy he discards ideals imposed by the external forces of man. opportunity pulls him, uncertainty awakens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cowboy is a vagabond, an icon of rugged individualism, a man surrounded in all directions by frontier. he answers only to his instinct. he is weathered by toil and vigilance. solitude revitalizes him, brings him closer to nature. death always near, looming at the horizon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its a lot easier to process &amp; understand an experience someone else is describing if u have already experienced it. It's also a lot more intuitive if that's the case. And I've experienced things that over 95% of people never will. There will always be that phenomenological lacuna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of people don't understand the spiritual concept of surrender or what it entails or how it unfolds in the greater process of awakening,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also a lot of people don't trust their intuition enough. They'll stay in a toxic place or with toxic people despite that being a huge factor in feeling distressed. It takes courage to listen to your mind and body and follow through,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm more content now than I probably have ever been because most external factors don't phase me like they used to. The energy I'm not wasting ruminating or worrying about a self in some competitive psychodrama has kept me in a creative flow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's not that I don't want I job, it's that I don't like feeling like I have to beg and fit arbitrary checkmarks for competence when I feel like what I offer far exceeds that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hence why my career path is so difficult. Especially with bipolar. I exist on a different plane of reality than other people and I know and am aware of so much and it's incredibly alienating to even talk to other people, it always feels like there's something missing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In case anyone is wondering my biggest fears are rejection, failure and not feeling good enough despite my talents, like I always having to prove myself for basic acceptance and recognition of competence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is one problem with giving the authority for primary sources to very select publications because these publications will abuse that power to write history as they see fit. This is a fundamental problem with historicity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep this in mind when you see the NYT, WaPo, NBC, CBS etc frame the current situation in Gaza with deliberate tactics like framing, passive voice and distancing, especially with today's front page of the NYT. We are seeing revisionist history in real time,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the NYT plays an enormous role in shaping the perception of the current world on the part of the politically active educated classes...and I believe that NYT editors bear a heavy burden in the sense that the NYT creates history - Noam Chomsky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://t.co/opNr1ONrUU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Isnt it a bit odd that the media &amp; oafish elites threw a bigger fit about Michelle Wolf's correspondence dinner speech than literally any of the war escalation and massacres of Palestinians in the past several weeks? We need a revolution in journalism.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My grammar was all over the place in those tweets but I hope what I said made sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How much do you see Trump being used as a target instead of legitimately more terrifying tactics used by the GOP like ramping up ICE, or reversing climate change/environmental protection policy, or enacting policy that further consolidates elite wealth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://t.co/6x3StGagxh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's not so much that Trump is that paper tiger it's that the media focuses so much on trivial one upsmanship. Liberals care more about proving everyone else wrong with an elitist mentality than actually doing anything to combat the looming spectre of fascism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If they have a paper tiger they can always prop up to distract from whats going on behind the scenes. You see time and time again in American history fear in conjunction with the media used to create artificial antagonism and diversion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then again I am still shocked daily by how ignorant and gullible the American public is, especially when they aren't challenged to question their political parties. Boomer libs just cling onto what they have for years and still provides them a sense of comfort,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems that Obama/Clinton had reason to ally with the deep state, primarily for continuation and consolidation of power and it backfired. I find it hard to believe that the pro-intelligence agency, pro-Russia narrative position pushed by the MSM is still convincing to people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And my anger always shifts to disappointment and pathos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Especially when you can stand back far enough from it all to see how time and time again it is their own arrogance and vanity that undermines them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seeing people not grow or learn from mistakes despite being successful or making strides in other aspects of their lives is such a massive disappointment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not even seeing their bad karma unfold in real time brings any sense of grim satisfaction or closure bc ultimately you realize they're the same person they were when they fucked you up. There's just a hollow separateness in which you see someone walking into a wall ad infinitum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Or they just plug their ears and go LALALALALALALA while whatever guilt they still have slowly festers inside them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social media allows people to forget and move on so easily. Redemption doesn't even exist anymore and they all just hop from one botched relationship to another,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A lotta people also have to consider that Buddhism is rough. Like there is a lot of dark shit," it's not just ""namaste"" and golden rule", it's a vehicle to the path of enlightenment, and that journey cannot always be a pleasant one because that's just the nature of existence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When cancel culture and media propaganda is no longer the status quo (which will likely not happen for as long as MSM exists) then I may consider saying things more palatable and optimistically righteous or whatever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And you know, considering how dark and vile so much of the media we consume is, (particularly stuff on Netflix or cinema) in a way I think I'm just holding up a warped mirror to society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Again, you have to see things in context with  the general canon of literature. A lot of literature employs devices meant to instill and provoke certain elements of the human condition, even uncomfortable ones. Please, grow a backbone and do not take all of my points literally,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Having said that I will still totally dunk on people or tear them to shreds if they abuse power or have shitty takes or make the web deliberately more fractured and toxic. Maybe that's just the nihilist vigilante in me idk. And yeah, I know I can be a hypocrite, that's inevitable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, my work is a sort of jumbled inconsistent contradictory pastiche of real and fictional elements, some of which I know reflect on me poorly, but that's kinda what I set out to do. You're meant to sift through the noise to find your own meaning or interpretation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd say I lean more towards criticizing culture, the state, socioeconomic trends and the media than I am an ideologue or political theorist. My specialty is literature and I also happen to be into politics and philosophy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@ByYourLogic are there still hostages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If we can widen the range of discussion for our lively debate to occur in that's a pro in my book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I try to use humor to frame a lot of my more taboo opinions but I know for a fact a LOT of people don't get me or find me funny and I'm cool with that because that's the position of vulnerability you have to put yourself in to make a difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I mean I hate cops. So there's that. I hate Israel. Tricky, uncomfortable topic. I'm anti-war, specifically neoconservative imperialism or whatever or subversive three-letter agency sabotage. But uhhh, i dunno, I think I generally have a clear conscience and consistent compass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I mean, I like Nick Mullen but a lot of people don't. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not really sure how I can frame my content lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You're perfectly free to disagree with me or call me a bigot but frankly I'm detached enough from my online persona for it to impact my day to day life. It's completely another thing if or as soon as my career enters the public sphere but idc my life is already in shambles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are definitely a lot of shitty people with shady morals about but I still think the majority are just pretty normal people who are against mainstream bipartisanship and normie scum. I often due things to offend but primarily for the sake of widening a window of discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even though I consider myself primarily a leftist anarchist I sometimes resonate more with certain alt-lite trolls than tankies you know what I mean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
leftist twitter beef is such a joke lol. I have such a weak grasp on the political spectrum of most of the accounts I like. I follow a ton of people on here I disagree with significantly but I follow them because I think it's important to observe the gestalt of the discourse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really resonates with me for where I'm at in my artistic/literary path and the methods which I employ for expressing my ideas &amp; emotions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

@KevinShau An argument we can have again, I'd be willing and able to break down any of his videos line by line, but Twitter is not the place for such a thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I think we remember that conversation very differently.  I quoted several lines of Peterson's and put them up against the data that corresponded, such as the wage gap existing consistently through ages(before child rearing age, and well after), through multiple fields, and more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I'd be very quick to be wary on any stat with one source.  Given that I've attempted to include multiple articles with the same points on anything you have asked for sources on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau We had a very large debate about the Wage gap on Facebook, in which i pulled govt labor data by age, gender and other metrics which directly countered Peterson's argument in his lecture.  For perspective," it was the ""women love faster microwaves"" lecture",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I would refer you back to my multiple tweets regarding how I do my research that include looking through sources such as Brietbart, Peterson's videos and named sources, and sources that may be more prestigious, such as WP, NYT, Fox, etc,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau You can skip the parts you find offensive, I'm not attempting to insult, but if it comes off that way, you are free to address the points that are based in fact, rather than the opinions along with it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau We have already had discussions of me breaking apart both Shapiro and Peterson's videos piece by piece.  We can do more of that, but Twitter is not the right venue for something as such.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I do not follow a party, a person blindly, or only seek arguments that support my initial thoughts.  I research fully," and from different viewpoints and form my own independent opinion.  I worry about anyone who finds 100% agreeability in a celebrity ""intellectual"" or politician",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I did not see those interviews on his channel, but I will double check.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TYT is a left wing Alex jones, utter trash.  I do not deal with hyperpartisan fact-less garbage like those.  I do not appreciate the attack on my open-mindedness, but I'll address that anyway:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Again, I've watched hours of his lectures, fact checked what he says," and researched the opinions on all ""sides"" of the spectrum.  Very little of it does he source", but I've also gone to his sources and checked those too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I think you do not understand the marketing piece here, there is a reason Peterson brought his net worth up," and makes his money from people on sites like Patreon.  ""Believe my message and donate for a good cause"" is the message", here and in Osteen and Trump(campaign)'s cases,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I'm not planning to read an 80 year old, 300 page piece to further this discussion, but I'll notate it on my amazon list for future reading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I was giving you multiple articles with confirmation of the question you asked.  I'm sorry you do not like the author's writing style.  Personally, I've always found Hemmingway to be hoary, so I know not everyone enjoys the same thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Also, I'd like to add:  an article that criticizes a man's positions using facts, figures," statistics and logic is not a ""hit-piece"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I'll give this a watch through today.  Regardless of how it plays out, it is nice to see Peterson actually move out of his comfort zone talking to students and reporters, and instead talking to oh...a reporter, and to be frank I don't know the guy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"@KevinShau You should know pretty well that I break from the ""leftist"" mold quite frequently.  I do thorough research through multiple sources from both ""sides""", from real," reputable journalists.  If your opinion is ""anyone who does not love peterson"" is writing polemics", so be it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I've watched hours of his lectures, fact checked his statements, researched for and against his arguments from all sides.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not intentionally condescending, but I'm sure it comes off that when when I'm speaking regarding ill-informed to the ill-informed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau The type of content in demand by people like Jones, Shapiro, Pool, TYT, is all sensationalized, biased, headline-driven, divisive, partisan crap,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Dave Rubin is opening on tour for Jordan Peterson and tweets about Peterson as a regular thing.  I also do not see any notable progressive or modern liberal people on his channel.  If you can not see and look past your own bias, we are both wasting our time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I believe that the opinion of Pool's validity is going to be an irreconcilable difference here.  I've watched his videos and I see what they are compared to Journalists who win real awards, and I it is negative, you think positive. That doesn't seem to be going anywhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Trump denounced the KKK, called them losers and they still love him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Unnecessary, I used the term to describe the fact that Peterson does not seem to force religious beliefs on his followers, but his tactics to gain followers are that of Joel Osteen or the like. (more a cross of Osteen and Trump),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Fallacy of anecdotal evidence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

@KevinShau https://t.co/csAHlNplmc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau 2/2 One for you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://t.co/4YCHPuexGH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau 1/2: I'm worried that your claim for sources will result in your attempt to attack reputable news organizations instead of furthering discussion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That being said:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau You asked for sources in a second tweet, to condense this nonsense I'll address that there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau For instance:  Violent crime by illegal immigrants is a huge issue in this country.  Emotionally? That may seem agreeable to a lot of people.  Factually, there are issues with this statement. We want to legislate on the data and facts," not on ""feelings"" and ""emotions""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Spoiler: That's the point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"@KevinShau ""Data is objective"," interpretation is not""  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm going to just let that sit there so you can just rethink that sentence. Think about that one REAL hard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Thats because Peterson makes sure to debate reporters and students, rather than properly researched and educated individuals, it adds to the myth he has real intelligence in the subject,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I'm sorry you see it that way, I hope you regain the independent thinking, thorough unbiased research, and ability to recognize those who only wish to indoctrinate the 'lost'(He is religion for the white male [in many cases atheist]),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau If there is greater access, then more people will be in the demand pool, meaning there needs to be a heavier supply.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I'm aware of biases in media and I take my news from either the most direct point possible," or various sources from different ""sides""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau You're not commenting on my point.  I'm not saying that CNN is right, I'm saying that Pool is not a media outlet giving out unbiased facts.  Nor would I consider him a Journalist, but I'd imagine that is a self-given title so I cant take that away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I'll repeat:  All his fans are not alt-right, however a large portion of alt-right are his fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Just because I hate Kevin Spacey does not mean kevin spacey also hates me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Peterson also works in the same way the alt-right does, just in his case with a sense of self-superiority.  Find disaffected young men and make them feel they are being attacked and only they can help.  It's a secular religion at its framework,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"@KevinShau Nobody I have seen is saying ""all his fans are alt-right""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A lot of people are saying he has a very large alt-right fanbase,  A large portion of people in the alt-right are fans of his.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Regardless of Peterson's true feelings towards the alt-right, he does have a very big fanbase in the alt-right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Dealing in facts is a much better way to get results. Dealing in opinions generally leads to emotional reactions over sensible reactions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"@KevinShau I saw it was neck and neck with John Oliver's ""Marlon Bundo"" book for a while",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I'm not mischaracterizing Pool.  He said that Peterson does like like the alt-right, and posted video evidence.  He then said this was evidence  the alt-right would not like Peterson (because the feeling was not mutual),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau The only other self described news I had seen it done on was Jones, I was not saying it in a negative way, just describing the video and putting it in a frame of reference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau If someone somehow found that Vox article before any other information, and stopped researching after reading it, I imagine they would have a biased view.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I'm not characterizing, I'm pulling information from Jordan himself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau He's a pseudo-intellectual snake oil salesman.  I know I'm attacking him as a person, and this is ad hominem," but I believe the source is important and I have spent much time attacking his ""work"" too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Pool, in a second video regarding Trump, is now attacking headlines on not containing the full story.  He fails to read the article and give context to the headlines.  Most people don't just read the Headline and take it at face value,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau This is not journalism, this is an opinion piece in defense of Peterson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau 9/?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pool so far has not shown any evidence the alt right doesn't like peterson(minus a quote from..peterson),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also He did not even dismissed his OWN straw-man argument provided at the beginning of this video.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau 8/?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pool earlier attacked the media for exageratting subscribers on youtube by saying ""thousands"" when in reality it is ""millions"".  He then goes back to say it is not millions.  (So at the least they are both idiots?).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau 7/?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hold on, he did make one," he quoted JORDAN PETERSON saying ""alt-right says I'm wrong"".(with no backup facts)",  Then he concedes the alt-right may like him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"@KevinShau 6/?  This is a 16 minute video and 10 minutes has been spent saying Peterson says he doesn't play identity politics"".  Pool made a point to say the alt-right doesnt like Peterson", and said that wasn't true.  He made no arguments to support it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau 5/?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Also:  Pool keeps saying that ""Peterson denied being alt right meaning he doesn't have alt right fans"" but that is a logical fallacy in itself. Peterson can dislike the alt-right", but the alt-right can still like him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"@KevinShau 4/?He attacks the ""daily dot"" opinion article", which I do not know that organization, but attacking opinion articles does not show press bias. Just opinion bias, which is a redundant term.  Pool's video here is clearly an opinionated defense of someone he respects, not journalism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau 3/?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pool criticizes an old video for saying Peterson has ""hundreds of thousands of followers"" on youtube when it is actually just over a million.  Seems nitpicky", but technically right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau 2/?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then he asked for money(is this alex jones?!).  Then he said that the alt-right couldn't love peterson, because Peterson doesn't love them. (Apparently both need to be true for either to be true?),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau 1/?  I watched another one of Pool's videos:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why is the media lying about Jordan Peterson(I thought it was relevant to the rest of this topic).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He starts out by creating a strawman argument that Peterson is aligning with facist organizations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"@KevinShau ""Peterson himself said in his Channel 4 interview that 80 percent of his YouTube audience is male. These young men are upset about . .  the need to compete with women and minorities for jobs and spots at top universities"," and they are angry.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Additionally," I'd point out if you went to work and your boss called you ""Melinda"""," and you told him ""oh"," it's actually Kevin""", yet your boss continues to call you Melinda, he is doing so out of harassment.  Should he be held liable at the workplace?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau While I'm not in love with the source website, this article may be the best I have read.  The writer does make a point to insert their personal view abruptly, but if you can ignore that, it is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://t.co/71Fx8cTKCH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"@KevinShau There is another LARGE difference between a ""unpopular"" position", and a discriminatory position.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau 3/3: Those letters also affirmed Peterson’s free speech rights and his right to academic freedom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau 2/3: One letter suggested that he could easily avoid contributing to discrimination by using a student’s first name, for instance, skipping the pronoun debate he was having in his head, entirely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau 1/3: That is avoiding the point that Peterson was upset at a bill for something the bill did not do.  Instead of targeting the code, he targets the bill that doesn't affect the situation he claims he is mad about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I do not know his work, as far as I can tell he hosts a media bash party in his living room on youtube.  You shared with me one of his videos a few months ago and it was full of logical flaws and logical fallacies to the extent I have not watched a second.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau No, the rest of it is, he has hours of talking about women's inability to be leaders, desire to have babies(otherwise something is wrong with them, per him).  Women's desire to work for material goods only.  Women need a masculine role to be whole...etc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau https://t.co/Hw0mt7pRCR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau We have discussed this numerous times," there is no verbiage in the legislation that allows for what Peterson feels will happen to happen.  The only thing that could happen is new ""worse"" laws are placed in"," then newer more ""worse"" laws", until..slippery slope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I'm sure it would, although I hardly see the benefit in forcing monogamy.  (Unless I go check with my good friends at reddit and see if they disagree),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau There are plenty of experts in that field.  None of which have said that Women want to help muslims so they can be dominated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Peterson is in the wrong here, and making assumptive excuses weakens your argument,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"@KevinShau and ""unconscious wish for brutal male domination"" is not an interest or desire of an entire gender", not only females.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd argue if you browse craigslist, you'll find that with males more often than not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"@KevinShau There is a LARGE difference between saying not ""only great things"" and ""Sexist", discriminatory," hypocritical and repeatedly wrong"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau 3/2: Now to be fair, Peterson did get letters from his university advising him that misgendering a student could be ruled a possible form of discrimination under a separate set of laws, in this case, Ontario’s provincial human rights code,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Not every piece that outs a fraud is a hit piece, when you have 500 of them it's time to think they might be on to something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not to mention Peterson has *multiple times* touted his honorary tribal membership that does not exist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau If you are trying to claim this man as a good journalist, and call him award winning, yet his awards are unrelated or not serious awards, I have no reason to believe that this man is a competent journalist.  When disagreeing with Multiple pulitzer prize winning journalists...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I have to have some fun!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Did you read the piece though?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau That neither addressed my point nor made one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau NYT, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, etc, all won Pulitzer Prizes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pool won an award that was given out to a Ke$ha(musician) fan club.(The Shorty),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau 2/2:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He even testified before Parliament on this, despite the fact that he has no expertise in civil rights or human rights law.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is ""slippery slope"" fallacy AGAIN",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau 1/2: on C-16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Peterson claimed that adding gender identity to the protected classes could possibly, maybe, someday lead to him, theoretically, just maybe, being fined for refusing to use a student’s preferred gender pronouns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I am not going to argue if that is right or wrong, but merely that this Vox article is an opinion piece so the argument of partisanship does not come into play here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau It is not good.  So Peterson is right that it is a bad movie, but because he believes the lack of a masculine role is necessary, not because it is just annoying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Also, aside from this point but Twitter threads are confusing.  Peterson supports gay marriage, but because it would decrease promiscuity, not because it would afford gay people more rights.  Talk about getting to the right answer the wrong way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Something rooted in sexism, with no basis not evidence to support it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"@KevinShau Neither was saying that Feminists support the rights of Muslims because of their ""unconscious wish for brutal male dominance"" nor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's good that you consumed the liquor instead of letting some Indian steal it(especially after crying honorary native american!  Pocohantus much?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau https://t.co/uyZXVyW4G8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Also I find his defense against racism that he is ""Honorary tribe member"" hilarious.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"@KevinShau You touted him as ""award winning"""," I took that to mean you placed enough importance to mention that.  He touts himself as ""award winning"" too.  That is akin to the companies that make up awards to assign themselves",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau https://t.co/tIxxid9RVX,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also a great piece by Petardson approved Source, reddit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"@KevinShau To quote the same sources Peterson uses: ""Dr. Peterson is a sexist. . . However"," he does support the underlying institutions that reinforce male dominance and he is paranoid about movements and art designed to dismantle them""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau But Epic Meal Time rival, Tim Pool gets it right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"@KevinShau ""nor must of his supporters are alt-right.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My sources win Pulitzer prizes, yours win awards that also go to Ke$ha fan pages on youtube.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I don't recall Tim Pool arguing that opinion pieces are the downfall of media.  This is an opinion piece you are attacking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Peterson argued that the Disney movie Frozen is propaganda which isn't relevant but is pretty hilarious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"@KevinShau Peterson also argued that women support the Muslim plight because it matched with their ""unconscious wish for brutal male domination'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau This coincidentally is in an interview with Peterson from Time magazine. Slippery slope present and highlighted https://t.co/fkfjyNgtz9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Your using Pool repeatedly as an example of an intellectual is laughable. He won an unrecognizable award(same award was given to Epic Meal Time and Justin Bieber),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He also was named Time person solely for live streaming an event on twitter. Hardly prestige earning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau It's an analysis based in fact. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ben Carson is a neurosurgeon, naming his degree and job doesn't excuse his misinformation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Most of the alt right agrees with him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do my research well, I am very thorough and I would not make claims without being able to back them up, albeit it is tough in 150 characters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau https://t.co/QoRJ0L9JdL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please do read this, keeping in mind it's an opinion piece,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Peterson is sexist and at the very least probably islamophoboc. He argues using common logical fallacies," mostly the ""slippery slope"" fallacy", it's prevent in almost all of his arguments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Peterson preys on disaffected young men, sets up encounters with people not formally educated in his field and slants the setting so he appears intelligent to angry people incapable of doing independent research.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Peterson is arguing conflicting points with conflicting data and poor sources, but it works on those who can not research independently and rely on the hive mind of the alt-right. (despite disowning the label),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau He sources Reddit, then says freer partners equals less violence with a shoddy source that also implies celibacy is even more nonviolent. That directly contradicts the other point that celibacy creates violence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I'd also question the Forced Monogomy Peterson proposes as a solution. That seems a lot like forcing a lifestyle choice, from how it reads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

@KevinShau Government should not discriminate, legislation would be necessary to prevent it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Yet Trump did,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Historically this has always been the case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau So let's allow people to be discriminated against?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fix the politics, correct the legislation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Again, define terms and prepare legislation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't say oh well it confuses me so let's let these people suffer discrimination,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau So, it hasn't happened.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instead of working to define these terms, throw it all out the window? No thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau That's is a false analogy, I'm not sure what your point would be here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau When has that happened? And don't mention Canada because we have discussed that isn't what the law is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Can you provide evidence? I'd argue it was on the decline slowly and the legislation speeded up the decline,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau A transgender person is an individual, the protection for their person is also for their group,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Though most do, currently is it impossible for others to outwardly identify outside those two. And those who do are able to be treated differently with no repercussions, including but not limited to employment, housing and legally,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Most biological males also identify as straight, so we should have no minorities for the protection of sexual preference?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Another humans gender identity affects you in no wsy. Forcing them to narrow theirs down to once of two is unnecessary and wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau You're thinking of biological sex,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I trust a group of well informed and educated people more than the mass population.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Shaming a gender is worse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Slippery slope fallacy, you're better than that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You aren't legislating subconscious, you're legislating the force of applying gender roles on others and legislation preventing discrimination on those who have gender roles that aren't your own. Give a step stool to those who need,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau And yes I am aware it is an oversimplification but I feel it helps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau And that is outside the rest of the facts in that case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Ignore the science. A woman you work with had an abortion, and then you circulate a memo saying they killed their baby. You aren't fired because you said something arguably factual, but for creating a hostile work environment for them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau There is a large difference between a sage space and a non hostile work environment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spewing blatant sexist garbage is a hostile work environment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Damore was, at least partially, fired for creating a hostile work environment by falsely claiming women were not equipped for the job, and circulating that message to employees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau This video was to show the bosses of parents and the idea that we subconsciously place gender roles on others,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Nobody wants to force someone to act in a way that doesn't match their gender, people want to keep society from forcing gender roles onto others.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Then you should do basic research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau  https://t.co/vTAuboAy4g,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau James Damore got fired for being an idiot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://t.co/0iZPuPV2nG,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau https://t.co/Ly27jPg6aa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I wouldn't argue that we need to destroy traditional gender roles, but get rid of the systemic sexism that helps leave them in place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I'll link you to monkeys throwing shit at eachother too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Traditional gender roles are breaking free naturally already, just slowly. All I want to do is loosen the chains. Help the progress rather than hinder it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I agree on the first half, the second half is because they are being bred that way, with the EZ-bake oven, Barbie, Disney princess childhood, the home-ec schooling and the pushing by people who grew up in a much stronger patriarchal society that is becoming increasingly outdated,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau We have to make those careers friendly to women. Look at the percentage of women who report abuse in STEM fields, then recognize that many do not report out of fear of retaliation. Look at the percentage of STEM field applicants to graduates, and recognize that those are related,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Because from a young age women aren't pushed into the idea that being housewives is a fine goal? That women should cook, clean and be mothers? There is data on the systemic sexism that does exist.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Women are more likely to do housework, but that isn't systemic? Are you high?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I'm on my phone in a car but that is stuff you can google or I can google for you when I'm near my desktop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau When those are accounted for a large gap still exists. The exact portion of percent is just Semantics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau The gap takes into account most of those factors if not all. Even when accounted for, a gap still exists. Pretending otherwise is ignorant and dangerous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau I’ve watched his videos on the wage gap, when it is verifiable, he calls it a myth and says women choose not to be successful and are poor leaders, who would rather have a faster microwave than a furthered career.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Let's not Use the term journalist so frivolously,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@KevinShau Paints him as a misogynist is easy when he is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

@magpies_history I was 12. Went with my Dad. All standing behind the goal when it went in. I wish I could have appreciated then how special it was. You can see me and my dad in the crowd when he scored.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Zeitgeist24_7 If oz spend the next year losing he will be welcomed back with open arms. Bancroft will have to hope they don’t find a decent opener!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As an England cricket team fan it’s time to let the Aussies get on with it and focus on why we haven’t won away since 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Zeitgeist24_7 Yes. I did start to wonder if the world had gone a little crazy at this point. There does need to be some perspective. He hasn’t killed anyone, he’s not in the same league as say Lance Armstrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Zeitgeist24_7 And why did they say it was sticky tape and not sandpaper? Did they think this sounded better?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And as a newer country their sporting achievements gives them a place on the world stage. They are also very patriotic and defensive of their country. This will have hurt proper Aussie cricket fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I should add I love Australia, I lived in Queensland and if they made planes faster and would have me I would happily live there forever. The reason they outperform their size at sport isn’t just because of the weather but because as a country they love their sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Zeitgeist24_7 I just sort of want to think Smith wasn’t that involved. He has always seemed a decent person to me but maybe you are right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Things don’t go there way. From what I understand just like in other sports cricketers get together after the sport had finished and enjoy the company of the opposition except when playing Oz!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ok one more thing. If we accept that Lehmann wasn’t involved surely he has to accept some blame for the culture that saw the team thrive on being hated. The Millwall of cricket. The Ashes will always be spicy yet oz seem to make enemies everywhere they go and then complain when..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Zeitgeist24_7 Have to wait 10 years for the autobiographies to know more!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Zeitgeist24_7 Sure, and I’m sure that’s why his punishment was less. But why go along with Warner of all people. I’m trying to imagine a new player in England team in 2011 choosing KP over the rest of the team. Is there deeper issues in the changing room or was Bancroft really that daft...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Different to 2011. England players couldn’t relax off the pitch and midnight curfew was introduced. They even laughed along with the Barmy Army realising it’s harder for fans to target players M Johnson style when they seem to be enjoying it. They just showed no weakness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finally I thought Australia were amazing off the field during the Ashes. They would have always won but they got inside the England players heads, whilst they looked composed and with eyes on the prize England were spending their time defending their culture which was no..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don’t understand why Bancroft would decide to align himself with Warner. All too strange #sandpapergate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only Warner was missing I noticed how close knit they were. Of course they were happy but they seemed comfortable together. Also Smith was totally in control, he ushered them around the casino. When he moved the whole team went too. He was totally in charge. This is again why...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the team were there including a few wives except for WARNER. They soon realised who we were but the vibe was generally positive and a few players asked us to sing some songs and had a laugh with us. Smith and his wife were there and Bancroft was there too. As well as noting..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On the night Oz won the Ashes I was with Barmy Army in Perth Casino. As it was past midnight this was the only place open in Perth and only one bar was open in there. Soon after arriving at the bar the Aussie team arrived, they had been having a meal and were staying there...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@kevina364 He is their KP.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He only cares about no1 and maybe the abuse had finally got to him. I know I’m supposed to hate Smith but I just feel sad, he was a machine during the ashes, whatever he does for the rest of his career it will always be overshadowed now, he had the chance to be a great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Care if the ball swings? He’s not bowling and none of the abuse has been personally aimed at him. Let’s say Warner did come to him with this plan surely telling your Captain and teammates is going to help your standing more esp when it was Warner idea! Warner is the KP of Aus..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My #sandpapergate thoughts for anyone who cares. I don’t get why Bancroft did it if it just came from Warner? Bancroft is new to the team, playing for his place and trying to find his place in the dressing room. So why ally with the least popular person? Also why does he,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really want Macc to get promoted. That is a horrid league to get out of and they have one of the smallest budgets and most of the club is run by fans. I loved my time at the club. #mtfc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

@ZaltzCricket So we didn’t even set any more records?!?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@AdelaideBarmies Agreed. Sky have been good for the game but we need some t20 at least on regular tv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nothing else compares. NZ is a tiny population compared to Eng and it’s not their number 1 sport. So yes we should expect to beat NZ and if we aren’t doing we need a massive rethink as a country about how we keep cricket as our no2 sport. #NZvsEng,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No longer seem to. It’s not just a middle class sport like in England and they don’t have football academy that snap up any sporty 6 yr old and make their focus just football. But when I lived in NZ I rarely met a Kiki who cared about cricket, rugby is a way of life there and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some thoughts for what they are worth... When I lived in Oz I *got* why they were good at cricket. Head to any park and see little kids playing the game, they aspire to be cricketters. T20 is on regular tv and the average Aussie seems to love the game in a way the English....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

@andrewdurrant75 Lol no but after season 1 it’s very much it’s own show and has little in common with the U.K. version. It has 9 seasons of 22 eps so the cast is a lot bigger too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@andrewdurrant75 He’s my favourite so that’s a good thing. Give American office a go, first season is awful but finds it’s stride by season 2 and honestly is the funniest show I’ve ever seen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

@twomuch77 I’m not saying this is the answer but like drug laws we can’t have a sensible conversation without people screaming about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@twomuch77 Well in America for example you can go direct to a specialist rather than through a GP. in Australia you can see a GP 24/7 but you pay for the privilege. We need to look at all ideas and be open to change,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What tv shows do you watch again and again? Mine is the office (American version!) god knows how many times I’ve seen it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@twomuch77 I don’t think it’s just about money. It’s about changing the whole way we use the service. I’m not necessary against money being raised through taxation I just think it’s an issue that no one can have an adult conversation about without ppl screaming that we are moving to US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Going to watch Notts together again just like we should be. #notts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notts do. My Dad also stopped going 10 years ago. Tonight, I went to his and we sat and watched the game together, chatting, ranting and generally being annoyed at Notts. It felt amazing to do that again and I know now it won’t be long until we are both,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I worked for the club 10 years ago and it didn’t end well. In fact it ended up with me utterly broken and falling out of love with the club. I’ve tried for a long time to get it back and it’s been so hard. Finally this season I am feeling it again and caring how,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Something good about tonight... I started watching Notts in 1991 when I was 10. Me and my dad going to every home game and the odd away game together. Having that time with my dad was amazing, especially as one of 5 as time alone was harder to come by. As some ppl know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fair play to Notts fans who sang all game. That mentality isn’t always there in football anymore and it was great to see #notts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes I feel sad that my best years of watching Notts was when I was 9 - 14 and didn’t really appreciate it but then I remember we have fans who have only ever seen us in the bottom 2 divisions after years of watching us #notts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well focusing on the league is important and we did make some decent money. We have to get out of this league.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9. Stop talking about the internet like something you have just discovered / been told about . Everytime I hear a Tory MP discuss the internet I cringe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8. Might seem petty but remove subsided bars / food from parliament. We need to regrow trust in our MPs and things like this just wind people up!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7. See prison as a way to rehabilitate rather than simply punish, how can we lock (mostly) men in cells for 23 hours a day and then send them back into the community with £30 and expect them to not re-offend! Gove had amazing ideas in this area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. Ban the export of live animals and increase the punishment for people found to be mistreating animals (life time ban should be the norm!),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Consumer rights need to be updated and tightened as we allow too many online rogue traders that you wouldn't see in your local shopping centre.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Re look at the system for house buying, buying houses in England is far more difficult than any other western country. The system needs to change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. As less people can afford to buy look at better rights for both tenants and landlords. Good landlords and tenants need to be treated better and rogue landlords should have banning orders / more severe punishment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

@CelticShirtShop Yeah chief, doesn't seem so long ago.. I met the wife then!! If you'd have told me back then, that I'd still be with her after 22yrs, I'd have said, I'd have laughed!! Just got lucky!! 😄 😉 👍 #HH 🍀 🇮🇪,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@CelticShirtShop Isn't it.. Accidental lucky find!! Was in the local sports shop for trainers in Cumnock, while waiting on the assistant coming back wae my trainers, I was sifting through a rack of football &amp; rugby shirts when I saw it.. So I just grabbed it, &amp; a Scottish rugby top I liked.. #HH https://t.co/cd5KxBXH4Q,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@CelticShirtShop Even though the Hoops are broken, I still like it.. Besides, it was a special year.. My daughter was born, we won the Treble, &amp; I was at the CIS final against Kilmarnock, Henrik hat-trick, &amp; St. Martin's first trophy!! #HH 🍀 🇮🇪 https://t.co/4xyq8Yd7op,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though I obviously see why people find it terrible, as the Nazis are abhorrent.. 👍,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@sue_lees @Far_Right_Watch @thisisradio3dom @CountDankulaTV @Glinner Yes, I really do. As I'd not only seen the Pug video, but plenty others too fella, as I'm a subscriber to his channel. Scottish sense of humour can be terribly dark, even to myself. I very rarely get offended! Now though there are people the polar opposite, &amp; perpetually offended,,,,,,,,,,,,,

@Colettekane20 Yes, she is, but worth it as you say! 😄 Seriously though.

Bitter auld hem pecked pr**ks, that look down on you! No time for people that think they're better than others!😡🖕,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

@Broxbhoy Worked out okay, for as well as gaining knowledge, you also got a new interest into the bargain!! Win, win.. 👍,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

@Broxbhoy There's a touristy bit at Dumfries, where your bound to see plenty of Red Kites here at, https://t.co/V7SdmXv0Hd Was lucky enough to grow up there.. 👍,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Broxbhoy That's like Cumnock mate.. Then there's stuff like that only an hours drive away at Loch Doon.. It's just as good at night for stargazing. They have an observatory &amp; thing going called The Dark Skies Project.  Even with the naked eye it's amazing. One of Britain's darkest places.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Broxbhoy Awesome isn't it.. Had those &amp; Red Kites,  even Golden Eagles at Loch Doon &amp; surrounding areas like the Galloway Forest, even Scots Wild Cats near a tiny place called Burnton.. I always loved watching the Kestrel hover, then dive to hunt!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Broxbhoy That's a pretty impressive amount of wildlife chief!! I'm not out &amp; about much here, even if I were, it couldn't compete with that!! 😄 Rats &amp; Royalty here, I'd there's any difference!! 😄 😉 👍,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Broxbhoy I used to get alot of Wrens, Pied Wagtails , &amp; Chaffinchs too.. A lot of birds &amp; other wildlife in my Garden went with the biggest tree in it.. It was the fella downstairs wha sent in a crew of guys in to cut it down.. 😡 Came back from a job too find it gone!! Gone since then!😡,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Broxbhoy I know!! What is it with the wee ones?! 😄 We only get a few Blue, or Great Tits, never in a Coal though.. It's a Robin I have in my back garden that tries too take on everything, even Gulls, for food, or just for the sake of it it seems, but likely territory.. 😄,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Broxbhoy Aye, you could have the making of a good joke there my man!! One of the kind like, The Loch Ness Monster, The Capercaillie, &amp; The Scottish Crossbill walked into a bar lol!! 😄 My favourite to have seen, &amp; had some of thier tiny eggs, are the Fire, &amp; Goldcrests.. So tiny.. 👍,,,,,,,,,,,
@Broxbhoy Aye is it buddy!! Also a great thing for the family to share a love of, other than the 'Tic of course!! 😄 Don't see as many birds here in Cumnock as I did in Bellsbank, between Dalmellington &amp; Loch Doon.. Loch Doon &amp; the surrounding forests &amp; countryside was where I grew up.. 👍,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
@Broxbhoy Ah, didn't know that about the cross breeding cheers fella, used to love bird watching.. When I was a boy, one of the very few things my Dad did with me whilst I'll, he died of cancer when I was 11, was egg collecting, which gave me a love of 'em.. 👍,,,,,,,,,,,,

@MichaELizabeth @WinsorJohn @ZKomala You are technically correct. As there was no resurrection, ever! Also, John, like most of us, were only told our preachers version of the so-called TRUTH!

@MichaELizabeth @WinsorJohn @ZKomala I hope, as I'm sure I am, very wrong about your intentions towards women, &amp; apologise fully in advance.

@MichaELizabeth @WinsorJohn @ZKomala any use to most of the human kind, if, as you say, your dreams &amp; teachings are mostly for the 7 mysterious &amp; no doubt, lucky ladies that you've loved many times, in many different lives? They are obviously also predestined to meet you, &amp; fall for you yet again in this one?  3of4,,,,,,,,,,,,
@MichaELizabeth @WinsorJohn @ZKomala Not to be nasty, but you present quotes from Jesus Christ Superstar, as prophecies &amp; facts.
