@annemarie6377 @blackhackglesga Yes it surely must be a good thing?! Although others would say 4 times nothing, is still nothing!! 😄 Some are never happy!! 😏😉 👍
@blackhackglesga @annemarie6377 Exactly mate.. That rate of growth surely can't be sustained, &amp; when it eventually happens, the likes of Preston will go to the wall, &amp; they won't be the only ones..😏👍
@annemarie6377 @blackhackglesga Exactly Anne-Marie.. It's now a pale imitation of it's former self.. It's an embarrassment now.. 👍
@blackhackglesga @annemarie6377 It's totally ruined, not just English football, but European too, to an extent.. I mean, what kind of person would rather sign for a struggling English team ahead of a club as massive as Celtic I'll never know?! But hey, the bubble will have to burst down south, then what?! 😏
@blackhackglesga @annemarie6377 Ain't it just!! If they even put half thier effort into talking it up, that they put into bringing it down, we might have half a chance.. To find out a couple of years ago that Gary Lineker was paid more in a year, than the entire amount to make Sportscene a year!! 😠
@blackhackglesga @annemarie6377 That's it boss!! That, plus perhaps the little amount of so-called "highlights" that they put on at daft o'clock, when my 12 year old Bhoy is in bed for school on the Monday.. A lot of time he sees Celtic highlights on BBC iplayer on the Monday.. But can see bàrca anytime..
@blackhackglesga @annemarie6377 Hope so fella!! The amount of kids these days that support English, Spanish, or even French teams these days as their first choice is heartbreaking.. Used to be an English or Spanish team we'd support for a 2nd team, now it's the other way round!! Just glad my Bhoy is Celtic 1st!

@quagmireisablue @LaughAtZombies Exactly! It'd be like Celtic in the EPL. With the amount of money on offer down there, we'd win it within' 3 years tops. It's why all EPL chairmen say no.

@DavidBowmanK @Far_Right_Watch @thisisradio3dom @CountDankulaTV @Glinner I get that too buddy. Must feel like the world &amp; his fuckin' dog are against him, pointing &amp; shouting Nazi ffs! In my opinion he's no Nazi or fascist, even if some defending him are! Perhaps why they're doing it, just to say hey, we're just misunderstood like Dankula?? 🤔 👍
@sue_lees @Far_Right_Watch @thisisradio3dom @CountDankulaTV @Glinner So I certainly can't blame you for having that opinion Sue..
@sue_lees @Far_Right_Watch @thisisradio3dom @CountDankulaTV @Glinner That would definitely not get the difference.. There's also another thing that seems a particularly British trait of finding irony hilarious.. The more ironic the better.. Like a Nazi Pug.. Though I obviously see why people find it terrible, as the Nazis are abhorrent.. 👍
@sue_lees @Far_Right_Watch @thisisradio3dom @CountDankulaTV @Glinner Yes, I really do. As I'd not only seen the Pug video, but plenty others too fella, as I'm a subscriber to his channel. Scottish sense of humour can be terribly dark, even to myself. I very rarely get offended! Now though there are people the polar opposite, &amp; perpetually offended

@Far_Right_Watch @thisisradio3dom @CountDankulaTV @Glinner I absolutely get that it was a joke with the pug that was perhaps tasteless to many, but meant as a joke.

@Colettekane20 Yes, she is, but worth it as you say! 😄 Seriously though. It is hard sometimes, it seems today's attitude is like when they hit some difficult times, or if  the slightest bit of boredom sets in they give up &amp; go elsewhere. I mean how can you not have bad times in a relationship?

@motivesnotknown @crimesofbrits True my good man, &amp; also nice of you to say that.. 👍 Just wish I could speak to him as a man, &amp; maybe I'd have found out just what his experience &amp; feelings were like??

@LiamCahill2013 @Stairnahireann Do you truly believe he was mentally ill?? 🤔 Or was that an early use of the, I was crazy at the time, excuse?? 🤔 👍
@LiamCahill2013 @Stairnahireann I know what you're saying, but in some ways, he was murdered by the British, even more so than the leaders.. They knew they were signing their own death warrant, when they put their names on the Proclamation.. The man would've been so terrified being a pacifist.. 👍
@donalthedub @Stairnahireann @IrishRepubIic Angry &amp; heartbreaking all in one.. A beautiful man, who never had a harmful bone in his body.. Left the Irish Citizen Army when they became militarised.. Evil scum.. 18 month in a mental hospital, pretty much recuperation, then sent to Canada with full pension!! 😡 Bastards mate!
@Stairnahireann Made a scapegoat, murdered by British Soldiers, &amp; they would've framed him for treason like the rest, if they'd have found even the most innocuous connection.. How they could put the leaders to death for treason, as like William Wallace, England was foreign to those brave men..

@Broxbhoy That's true!! I see your point!! 😄 Never thought of it that way, as when I saw them around there, it was through camping,  hillwalking, &amp; going round the bothies &amp; fishing the Lochs there.. I've never done the trail..
@Broxbhoy Worked out okay, for as well as gaining knowledge, you also got a new interest into the bargain!! Win, win.. 👍
@Broxbhoy 😂😂😂Class.. I'd have done the same mate.. You were just unlucky!! 😄
@Broxbhoy There's a touristy bit at Dumfries, where your bound to see plenty of Red Kites here at, https://t.co/V7SdmXv0Hd Was lucky enough to grow up there.. 👍
@Broxbhoy That's like Cumnock mate.. Then there's stuff like that only an hours drive away at Loch Doon.. It's just as good at night for stargazing. They have an observatory &amp; thing going called The Dark Skies Project.  Even with the naked eye it's amazing. One of Britain's darkest places.
@Broxbhoy Awesome isn't it.. Had those &amp; Red Kites,  even Golden Eagles at Loch Doon &amp; surrounding areas like the Galloway Forest, even Scots Wild Cats near a tiny place called Burnton.. I always loved watching the Kestrel hover, then dive to hunt!!
@Broxbhoy That's a pretty impressive amount of wildlife chief!! I'm not out &amp; about much here, even if I were, it couldn't compete with that!! 😄 Rats &amp; Royalty here, I'd there's any difference!! 😄 😉 👍
@Broxbhoy I used to get alot of Wrens, Pied Wagtails , &amp; Chaffinchs too.. A lot of birds &amp; other wildlife in my Garden went with the biggest tree in it.. It was the fella downstairs wha sent in a crew of guys in to cut it down.. 😡 Came back from a job too find it gone!! Gone since then!😡
@Broxbhoy I know!! What is it with the wee ones?! 😄 We only get a few Blue, or Great Tits, never in a Coal though.. It's a Robin I have in my back garden that tries too take on everything, even Gulls, for food, or just for the sake of it it seems, but likely territory.. 😄
@Broxbhoy Aye, you could have the making of a good joke there my man!! One of the kind like, The Loch Ness Monster, The Capercaillie, &amp; The Scottish Crossbill walked into a bar lol!! 😄 My favourite to have seen, &amp; had some of thier tiny eggs, are the Fire, &amp; Goldcrests.. So tiny.. 👍
@Broxbhoy Aye is it buddy!! Also a great thing for the family to share a love of, other than the 'Tic of course!! 😄 Don't see as many birds here in Cumnock as I did in Bellsbank, between Dalmellington &amp; Loch Doon.. Loch Doon &amp; the surrounding forests &amp; countryside was where I grew up.. 👍
@Broxbhoy Ah, didn't know that about the cross breeding cheers fella, used to love bird watching.. When I was a boy, one of the very few things my Dad did with me whilst I'll, he died of cancer when I was 11, was egg collecting, which gave me a love of 'em.. 👍

@BeckhamPm @KirkyShamrock @Colettekane20 My mother was an awesome old fashioned knitter, &amp; her biggest pet hate, really was wasted wool!!

Just a tweet to apologise for going on a bit of a rant in your timeline, to a reply to one of your tweets my good man. @WinsorJohn After reading about his Dreams, multiple lives, personal revelations frm God, I thought he was harmless nuts, but now not sure? Th bit abt 7🚺creepy!
@MichaELizabeth @WinsorJohn @ZKomala You are technically correct. As there was no resurrection, ever! Also, John, like most of us, were only told our preachers version of the so-called TRUTH! John's book, his own words describes it best, reveals many of the ways that Christian Leaders obfuscate the Bibles meaning!
@MichaELizabeth @WinsorJohn @ZKomala I hope, as I'm sure I am, very wrong about your intentions towards women, &amp; apologise fully in advance. It just sounds like pick up lines that could be used by the unscrupulous, on religious or spiritual women, who could become vulnerable to it's charms for sheer want of belief.
@MichaELizabeth @WinsorJohn @ZKomala The 7 woman part is kinda disturbing too me, I'm sorry to say. I'm pretty sure you mean no harm like, but it's kinda like your hoping to catch the attention of some of the lonely unhappy single women out there, who like us all really, just wanna love, be loved &amp; feel special 4of5
@MichaELizabeth @WinsorJohn @ZKomala any use to most of the human kind, if, as you say, your dreams &amp; teachings are mostly for the 7 mysterious &amp; no doubt, lucky ladies that you've loved many times, in many different lives? They are obviously also predestined to meet you, &amp; fall for you yet again in this one?  3of4
@MichaELizabeth @WinsorJohn @ZKomala Not to be nasty, but you present quotes from Jesus Christ Superstar, as prophecies &amp; facts. You admit the extent of your research is the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Nag Hammadi Codices, which are stories written by men in primitive times, &amp; your dreams. Why would your teachings be 2of3
@MichaELizabeth @WinsorJohn @ZKomala Sorry, after reading that seems you've delusions of grandeur at the very least! You wanna be remembered long after you're gone, I get that, I'm sure a lot do! Our ego's don't wanna be forgotten! But most will be, except for the few greats who do something to change the world!1of2

@CNnylf @crimesofbrits They've sure found their White Knight in you!! 😄 So, in your mind, the colour of my skin, being a man, &amp; because I'm 40 means I'm totally wrong?! What women today do you think, could hold a candle too someone like say, Helen Blackburn, or Constance Markievicz?? 🤔
