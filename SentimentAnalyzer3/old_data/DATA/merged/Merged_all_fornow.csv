Plain and simple. The more we recognize propaganda as legitimate the more we're changing the legacy of American imperialism by absolving and softening crimes against humanity. It's appalling and more people should be upset.We're trying to give war criminals the benefit of the doubt with retroactive praise via the mainstream media. You see it with the Bush familyRT @chomsky_quotes: One fundamental goal of any well-crafted indoctrination program is to direct attention elsewhereAlso why the fuck are we giving Obama a netflix series? We willingly lose paradise more and more every year. Why is HBO releasing a propaganda documentary on McCain just as he's about to croak? Does this not seem weird to anyone else?Think of the impact technology and mass entertainment has had on re-wiring the brains of gen z. They live in a fundamentally warped view of the world.Stop making shitty people famous. Stop making fame seem more important than it is. Reinstill the values that promote a healthy family unit or we'll continue to have parents who raise fuck up reactionary failchildren who resort to murder for attention.In a world where sociopaths aren't given attention they'd rather take a legacy of infamy than no legacy at all. And honestly given how the media chooses to cover and oversaturate certain stories we really have no one but ourselves to blame. It's a byproduct of consumer culture.honestly I think we have the media and entertainment culture to blame for the current political climate and to a large extent the school shooter epidemic. give attention to the wrong thingsyeezy prolly gonna re-release red octobers but make them MAGA themed smdh https://t.co/9ZJ6uty1Vra mood :/ https://t.co/w90XO0YXMK"would be neat if we had JD in the states solely for the sake of being able to say shit like ""brevs"uniqlo also satiates my more streetwear sensibilities but is minimal enough that I don't feel like a hypebeast wearing it _Ÿ˜__Ÿ‘ŒUniqlo is like american apparel but the clothes isn't all designed for anorexic body typesI'm not asian but I will gladly continue to stan uniqlo indefinitely lol _Ÿ›çï¸è https://t.co/ZheOjdS3GOgut flora stay woke one hundredprotip: 'going with your gut' is a lot easier if you take probiotics and consume things like greek yogurt or kombucha _Ÿ’¯_Ÿ‘ŒRT @CarvingDivine: â€œHard to restrainyo anyone got the plug for oxytocinfinna put on transatlanticism and bawl so hard â˜ùï¸è_Ÿ˜”_Ÿ_¶when Ben Gibbard said "Cause in my head there's a Greyhound station, where I send my thoughts to far off destinations so they may have a chance of finding a place where they're far more suited than here"I resonated deeply with that on an emotional and spiritual lvl..._Ÿ˜__Ÿ‘Œ_Ÿ’¯https://t.co/8bFBUhUhtWRT @RemyVampVuitton: When is supreme gonna collab with yu gi ohneed a queen _Ÿ‘‘_Ÿ˜˜RT @chomsky_quotes: ... the media serve the interests of state and corporate power@charli_xcx _Ÿ’–RT @threat_update: https://t.co/XWOwIjnQkIRT @ViddyMalchick: https://t.co/2mlcJoA4gXTheÂ arcÂ of the moral universeÂ is long"The idea of a ""media class"" that is just a more detached solipsistic extension of liberal urbanite elitism  is awful and provides nothing of value to the common people.

BroAlso2018: Hipster neurotypicals disregarding context for performative in-group brownie points and self-aggrandizementThe people who are denoted as geniuses by contemporary society are often given that status after that person has already become successful via either business or academia. It's retroactive. Clout. A reflection of that person's perceived success. Completely different.I'd say that capitalism doesn't reward geniusIt also suggests that genius is a product of society or history and not of the mind of an individual. How society perceives or ranks a figure has nothing to do with that individual's objective ability. https://t.co/Dn7lmA0NYhAll of these arguments are pulled out of thin air and poorly explained. Rubbish. No scientific or historical context whatsoever. Perfectly illustrates the myopia of the current culture.

All standing behind the goal when it went in. I wish I could have appreciated then how special it was. You can see me and my dad in the crowd when he scored.@Zeitgeist24_7 If oz spend the next year losing he will be welcomed back with open arms. Bancroft will have to hope they donâ€™t find a decent opener!As an England cricket team fan itâ€™s time to let the Aussies get on with it and focus on why we havenâ€™t won away since 2016.@Zeitgeist24_7 Yes. I did start to wonder if the world had gone a little crazy at this point. There does need to be some perspective. He hasnâ€™t killed anyone@Zeitgeist24_7 And why did they say it was sticky tape and not sandpaper? Did they think this sounded better?And as a newer country their sporting achievements gives them a place on the world stage. They are also very patriotic and defensive of their country. This will have hurt proper Aussie cricket fans.I should add I love Australia@Zeitgeist24_7 I just sort of want to think Smith wasnâ€™t that involved. He has always seemed a decent person to me but maybe you are right.Things donâ€™t go there way. From what I understand just like in other sports cricketers get together after the sport had finished and enjoy the company of the opposition except when playing Oz!Ok one more thing. If we accept that Lehmann wasnâ€™t involved surely he has to accept some blame for the culture that saw the team thrive on being hated. The Millwall of cricket. The Ashes will always be spicy yet oz seem to make enemies everywhere they go and then complain when..@Zeitgeist24_7 Have to wait 10 years for the autobiographies to know more!@Zeitgeist24_7 SureDifferent to 2011. England players couldnâ€™t relax off the pitch and midnight curfew was introduced. They even laughed along with the Barmy Army realising itâ€™s harder for fans to target players M Johnson style when they seem to be enjoying it. They just showed no weakness.Finally I thought Australia were amazing off the field during the Ashes. They would have always won but they got inside the England players headsI donâ€™t understand why Bancroft would decide to align himself with Warner. All too strange #sandpapergateOnly Warner was missing I noticed how close knit they were. Of course they were happy but they seemed comfortable together. Also Smith was totally in controlAll the team were there including a few wives except for WARNER. They soon realised who we were but the vibe was generally positive and a few players asked us to sing some songs and had a laugh with us. Smith and his wife were there and Bancroft was there too. As well as noting..On the night Oz won the Ashes I was with Barmy Army in Perth Casino. As it was past midnight this was the only place open in Perth and only one bar was open in there. Soon after arriving at the bar the Aussie team arrived@kevina364 He is their KP.He only cares about no1 and maybe the abuse had finally got to him. I know Iâ€™m supposed to hate Smith but I just feel sadCare if the ball swings? Heâ€™s not bowling and none of the abuse has been personally aimed at him. Letâ€™s say Warner did come to him with this plan surely telling your Captain and teammates is going to help your standing more esp when it was Warner idea! Warner is the KP of Aus..My #sandpapergate thoughts for anyone who cares. I donâ€™t get why Bancroft did it if it just came from Warner? Bancroft is new to the teamI really want Macc to get promoted. That is a horrid league to get out of and they have one of the smallest budgets and most of the club is run by fans. I loved my time at the club. #mtfc.@GerritForward I didnâ€™t see last promotion season. How does this team compare? 97/98 team were very special.
