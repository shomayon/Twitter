@BaphomentButt I'm not too well informed on Kanye's personal life, but there have been many rumours of Kanye West being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so I'm not going to assume he is being ignorant here(I also don't want to assume he is not).  The album 🔥🔥🔥 though
@BaphomentButt I apologize for the implications this post makes, and the lack of context, this is the cover of Kanye West's new CD

@Critter_X Eater/Buick lane.  For Eaters and people driving Buicks.
@Critter_X I'm actually all for the eater lane idea
@Critter_X So, I guess Variable speed limit systems exist and seem to work where implemented.  I agree that too many people do not know how to drive, but that should not make my commute longer.  The hurry is I need time to eat more.
@jaleelattah @kanyewest Oh damn that was fast, thanks much
Also someone @ me when @Drake wakes up from the coma @PUSHA_T put him in. 
Thanks.
Someone @ me when Ye drops. @kanyewest
Different lanes need different speed limits. Thank me later.
I feel like Trump going off on a tweet rampage, but maybe next time @POTUS goes on a tweet spree at a stupid time it can be for something worth caring about.
If restricting additional checks on buying firearms is more important to you than the safety of classrooms, you should not be trusted with a firearm
If you feel children dying is just some unfixable side effect of keeping your guns, you don't have the mental stability to own firearms in the first place.
When we become desensitized to these events happening, we need to try anything and everything. One is too many.
"Bans are bad, they don't work"-Republicans
"Ban trench coats to stop shootings"-Republicans
Hmm...
Maybe it IS the guns, lets just try it.  Aren't these &gt;100 kids who have been killed reason enough to try?
@KevinShau I've found no evidence there is consensus that they are anywhere among the "top living intellectuals", albeit a subjective superlative.
Check out some of these people that I've consistently found: Noam Chomsky, Richard Dawkins(&amp; Mary Midgley), Simon Blackburn. Peter Singer.
You know who gets real mad when you call the Right a bunch of racist old white dudes?

Racist old white dudes.
@KevinShau An argument we can have again, I'd be willing and able to break down any of his videos line by line, but Twitter is not the place for such a thing
@KevinShau I think we remember that conversation very differently.  I quoted several lines of Peterson's and put them up against the data that corresponded, such as the wage gap existing consistently through ages(before child rearing age, and well after), through multiple fields, and more.
@KevinShau I'd be very quick to be wary on any stat with one source.  Given that I've attempted to include multiple articles with the same points on anything you have asked for sources on.
@KevinShau We had a very large debate about the Wage gap on Facebook, in which i pulled govt labor data by age, gender and other metrics which directly countered Peterson's argument in his lecture.  For perspective, it was the "women love faster microwaves" lecture
@KevinShau I would refer you back to my multiple tweets regarding how I do my research that include looking through sources such as Brietbart, Peterson's videos and named sources, and sources that may be more prestigious, such as WP, NYT, Fox, etc
@KevinShau You can skip the parts you find offensive, I'm not attempting to insult, but if it comes off that way, you are free to address the points that are based in fact, rather than the opinions along with it
@KevinShau We have already had discussions of me breaking apart both Shapiro and Peterson's videos piece by piece.  We can do more of that, but Twitter is not the right venue for something as such.
@KevinShau I do not follow a party, a person blindly, or only seek arguments that support my initial thoughts.  I research fully, and from different viewpoints and form my own independent opinion.  I worry about anyone who finds 100% agreeability in a celebrity "intellectual" or politician
@KevinShau I did not see those interviews on his channel, but I will double check.
TYT is a left wing Alex jones, utter trash.  I do not deal with hyperpartisan fact-less garbage like those.  I do not appreciate the attack on my open-mindedness, but I'll address that anyway:
@KevinShau Again, I've watched hours of his lectures, fact checked what he says, and researched the opinions on all "sides" of the spectrum.  Very little of it does he source, but I've also gone to his sources and checked those too
@KevinShau I think you do not understand the marketing piece here, there is a reason Peterson brought his net worth up, and makes his money from people on sites like Patreon.  "Believe my message and donate for a good cause" is the message, here and in Osteen and Trump(campaign)'s cases
@KevinShau I'm not planning to read an 80 year old, 300 page piece to further this discussion, but I'll notate it on my amazon list for future reading.
@KevinShau I was giving you multiple articles with confirmation of the question you asked.  I'm sorry you do not like the author's writing style.  Personally, I've always found Hemmingway to be hoary, so I know not everyone enjoys the same thing.
@KevinShau Also, I'd like to add:  an article that criticizes a man's positions using facts, figures, statistics and logic is not a "hit-piece".
@KevinShau I'll give this a watch through today.  Regardless of how it plays out, it is nice to see Peterson actually move out of his comfort zone talking to students and reporters, and instead talking to oh...a reporter, and to be frank I don't know the guy.
@KevinShau You should know pretty well that I break from the "leftist" mold quite frequently.  I do thorough research through multiple sources from both "sides", from real, reputable journalists.  If your opinion is "anyone who does not love peterson" is writing polemics, so be it
@KevinShau I've watched hours of his lectures, fact checked his statements, researched for and against his arguments from all sides.
I'm not intentionally condescending, but I'm sure it comes off that when when I'm speaking regarding ill-informed to the ill-informed
@KevinShau The type of content in demand by people like Jones, Shapiro, Pool, TYT, is all sensationalized, biased, headline-driven, divisive, partisan crap
@KevinShau Dave Rubin is opening on tour for Jordan Peterson and tweets about Peterson as a regular thing.  I also do not see any notable progressive or modern liberal people on his channel.  If you can not see and look past your own bias, we are both wasting our time
@KevinShau I believe that the opinion of Pool's validity is going to be an irreconcilable difference here.  I've watched his videos and I see what they are compared to Journalists who win real awards, and I it is negative, you think positive. That doesn't seem to be going anywhere.
@KevinShau Trump denounced the KKK, called them losers and they still love him.
@KevinShau Unnecessary, I used the term to describe the fact that Peterson does not seem to force religious beliefs on his followers, but his tactics to gain followers are that of Joel Osteen or the like. (more a cross of Osteen and Trump)
@KevinShau Fallacy of anecdotal evidence
@KevinShau https://t.co/crXHjpzjpB
@KevinShau https://t.co/csAHlNplmc
@KevinShau 2/2 One for you
https://t.co/4YCHPuexGH
@KevinShau 1/2: I'm worried that your claim for sources will result in your attempt to attack reputable news organizations instead of furthering discussion.
That being said:
@KevinShau You asked for sources in a second tweet, to condense this nonsense I'll address that there
@KevinShau For instance:  Violent crime by illegal immigrants is a huge issue in this country.  Emotionally? That may seem agreeable to a lot of people.  Factually, there are issues with this statement. We want to legislate on the data and facts, not on "feelings" and "emotions"
@KevinShau Spoiler: That's the point.
@KevinShau "Data is objective, interpretation is not"  
I'm going to just let that sit there so you can just rethink that sentence. Think about that one REAL hard.
@KevinShau Thats because Peterson makes sure to debate reporters and students, rather than properly researched and educated individuals, it adds to the myth he has real intelligence in the subject
@KevinShau I'm sorry you see it that way, I hope you regain the independent thinking, thorough unbiased research, and ability to recognize those who only wish to indoctrinate the 'lost'(He is religion for the white male [in many cases atheist])
@KevinShau If there is greater access, then more people will be in the demand pool, meaning there needs to be a heavier supply.
@KevinShau I'm aware of biases in media and I take my news from either the most direct point possible, or various sources from different "sides"
@KevinShau You're not commenting on my point.  I'm not saying that CNN is right, I'm saying that Pool is not a media outlet giving out unbiased facts.  Nor would I consider him a Journalist, but I'd imagine that is a self-given title so I cant take that away
@KevinShau I'll repeat:  All his fans are not alt-right, however a large portion of alt-right are his fans.
@KevinShau Just because I hate Kevin Spacey does not mean kevin spacey also hates me
@KevinShau Peterson also works in the same way the alt-right does, just in his case with a sense of self-superiority.  Find disaffected young men and make them feel they are being attacked and only they can help.  It's a secular religion at its framework
@KevinShau Nobody I have seen is saying "all his fans are alt-right"
A lot of people are saying he has a very large alt-right fanbase,  A large portion of people in the alt-right are fans of his.
@KevinShau Regardless of Peterson's true feelings towards the alt-right, he does have a very big fanbase in the alt-right.
@KevinShau Dealing in facts is a much better way to get results. Dealing in opinions generally leads to emotional reactions over sensible reactions.
@KevinShau I saw it was neck and neck with John Oliver's "Marlon Bundo" book for a while
@KevinShau I'm not mischaracterizing Pool.  He said that Peterson does like like the alt-right, and posted video evidence.  He then said this was evidence  the alt-right would not like Peterson (because the feeling was not mutual)
@KevinShau The only other self described news I had seen it done on was Jones, I was not saying it in a negative way, just describing the video and putting it in a frame of reference
@KevinShau If someone somehow found that Vox article before any other information, and stopped researching after reading it, I imagine they would have a biased view.
@KevinShau I'm not characterizing, I'm pulling information from Jordan himself
@KevinShau He's a pseudo-intellectual snake oil salesman.  I know I'm attacking him as a person, and this is ad hominem, but I believe the source is important and I have spent much time attacking his "work" too.
@KevinShau Pool, in a second video regarding Trump, is now attacking headlines on not containing the full story.  He fails to read the article and give context to the headlines.  Most people don't just read the Headline and take it at face value
@KevinShau This is not journalism, this is an opinion piece in defense of Peterson
@KevinShau 9/?
Pool so far has not shown any evidence the alt right doesn't like peterson(minus a quote from..peterson)
Also He did not even dismissed his OWN straw-man argument provided at the beginning of this video.
@KevinShau 8/?
Pool earlier attacked the media for exageratting subscribers on youtube by saying "thousands" when in reality it is "millions".  He then goes back to say it is not millions.  (So at the least they are both idiots?).
@KevinShau 7/?
Hold on, he did make one, he quoted JORDAN PETERSON saying "alt-right says I'm wrong".(with no backup facts),  Then he concedes the alt-right may like him.
@KevinShau 6/?  This is a 16 minute video and 10 minutes has been spent saying Peterson says he doesn't play identity politics".  Pool made a point to say the alt-right doesnt like Peterson, and said that wasn't true.  He made no arguments to support it.
@KevinShau 5/?
Also:  Pool keeps saying that "Peterson denied being alt right meaning he doesn't have alt right fans" but that is a logical fallacy in itself. Peterson can dislike the alt-right, but the alt-right can still like him.
@KevinShau 4/?He attacks the "daily dot" opinion article, which I do not know that organization, but attacking opinion articles does not show press bias. Just opinion bias, which is a redundant term.  Pool's video here is clearly an opinionated defense of someone he respects, not journalism
@KevinShau 3/?
Pool criticizes an old video for saying Peterson has "hundreds of thousands of followers" on youtube when it is actually just over a million.  Seems nitpicky, but technically right.
@KevinShau 2/?
Then he asked for money(is this alex jones?!).  Then he said that the alt-right couldn't love peterson, because Peterson doesn't love them. (Apparently both need to be true for either to be true?)
@KevinShau 1/?  I watched another one of Pool's videos:
"Why is the media lying about Jordan Peterson"(I thought it was relevant to the rest of this topic).
He starts out by creating a strawman argument that Peterson is aligning with facist organizations.
@KevinShau "Peterson himself said in his Channel 4 interview that 80 percent of his YouTube audience is male. These young men are upset about . .  the need to compete with women and minorities for jobs and spots at top universities, and they are angry."
@KevinShau Additionally, I'd point out if you went to work and your boss called you "Melinda", and you told him "oh, it's actually Kevin", yet your boss continues to call you Melinda, he is doing so out of harassment.  Should he be held liable at the workplace?
@KevinShau While I'm not in love with the source website, this article may be the best I have read.  The writer does make a point to insert their personal view abruptly, but if you can ignore that, it is great.

https://t.co/71Fx8cTKCH
@KevinShau There is another LARGE difference between a "unpopular" position, and a discriminatory position.
@KevinShau 3/3: Those letters also affirmed Peterson’s free speech rights and his right to academic freedom.
@KevinShau 2/3: One letter suggested that he could easily avoid contributing to discrimination by using a student’s first name, for instance, skipping the pronoun debate he was having in his head, entirely.
@KevinShau 1/3: That is avoiding the point that Peterson was upset at a bill for something the bill did not do.  Instead of targeting the code, he targets the bill that doesn't affect the situation he claims he is mad about.
@KevinShau I do not know his work, as far as I can tell he hosts a media bash party in his living room on youtube.  You shared with me one of his videos a few months ago and it was full of logical flaws and logical fallacies to the extent I have not watched a second.
@KevinShau No, the rest of it is, he has hours of talking about women's inability to be leaders, desire to have babies(otherwise something is wrong with them, per him).  Women's desire to work for material goods only.  Women need a masculine role to be whole...etc
@KevinShau https://t.co/Hw0mt7pRCR
@KevinShau We have discussed this numerous times, there is no verbiage in the legislation that allows for what Peterson feels will happen to happen.  The only thing that could happen is new "worse" laws are placed in, then newer more "worse" laws, until..slippery slope.
@KevinShau I'm sure it would, although I hardly see the benefit in forcing monogamy.  (Unless I go check with my good friends at reddit and see if they disagree)
@KevinShau There are plenty of experts in that field.  None of which have said that Women want to help muslims so they can be dominated.
Peterson is in the wrong here, and making assumptive excuses weakens your argument
@KevinShau and "unconscious wish for brutal male domination" is not an interest or desire of an entire gender, not only females.
I'd argue if you browse craigslist, you'll find that with males more often than not.
@KevinShau There is a LARGE difference between saying not "only great things" and "Sexist, discriminatory, hypocritical and repeatedly wrong".
@KevinShau 3/2: Now to be fair, Peterson did get letters from his university advising him that misgendering a student could be ruled a possible form of discrimination under a separate set of laws, in this case, Ontario’s provincial human rights code
@KevinShau Not every piece that outs a fraud is a hit piece, when you have 500 of them it's time to think they might be on to something.
Not to mention Peterson has *multiple times* touted his honorary tribal membership that does not exist
@KevinShau If you are trying to claim this man as a good journalist, and call him award winning, yet his awards are unrelated or not serious awards, I have no reason to believe that this man is a competent journalist.  When disagreeing with Multiple pulitzer prize winning journalists...
@KevinShau I have to have some fun!
Did you read the piece though?
@KevinShau That neither addressed my point nor made one
@KevinShau NYT, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, etc, all won Pulitzer Prizes.
Pool won an award that was given out to a Ke$ha(musician) fan club.(The Shorty)
@KevinShau 2/2:
He even testified before Parliament on this, despite the fact that he has no expertise in civil rights or human rights law.

This is "slippery slope" fallacy AGAIN
@KevinShau 1/2: on C-16
Peterson claimed that adding gender identity to the protected classes could possibly, maybe, someday lead to him, theoretically, just maybe, being fined for refusing to use a student’s preferred gender pronouns.
@KevinShau I am not going to argue if that is right or wrong, but merely that this Vox article is an opinion piece so the argument of partisanship does not come into play here.
@KevinShau It is not good.  So Peterson is right that it is a bad movie, but because he believes the lack of a masculine role is necessary, not because it is just annoying.
@KevinShau Also, aside from this point but Twitter threads are confusing.  Peterson supports gay marriage, but because it would decrease promiscuity, not because it would afford gay people more rights.  Talk about getting to the right answer the wrong way
@KevinShau Something rooted in sexism, with no basis not evidence to support it.
@KevinShau Neither was saying that Feminists support the rights of Muslims because of their "unconscious wish for brutal male dominance" nor
"it's good that you consumed the liquor instead of letting some Indian steal it"(especially after crying honorary native american!  Pocohantus much?
@KevinShau https://t.co/uyZXVyW4G8
Also I find his defense against racism that he is "Honorary tribe member" hilarious.
@KevinShau You touted him as "award winning", I took that to mean you placed enough importance to mention that.  He touts himself as "award winning" too.  That is akin to the companies that make up awards to assign themselves
@KevinShau https://t.co/tIxxid9RVX
Also a great piece by Petardson approved Source, reddit.
@KevinShau To quote the same sources Peterson uses: "Dr. Peterson is a sexist. . . However, he does support the underlying institutions that reinforce male dominance and he is paranoid about movements and art designed to dismantle them"
@KevinShau But Epic Meal Time rival, Tim Pool gets it right?
@KevinShau "nor must of his supporters are alt-right."
-You.

My sources win Pulitzer prizes, yours win awards that also go to Ke$ha fan pages on youtube.
@KevinShau I don't recall Tim Pool arguing that opinion pieces are the downfall of media.  This is an opinion piece you are attacking.
@KevinShau Peterson argued that the Disney movie Frozen is propaganda which isn't relevant but is pretty hilarious
@KevinShau Peterson also argued that women support the Muslim plight because it matched with their "unconscious wish for brutal male domination'
@KevinShau This coincidentally is in an interview with Peterson from Time magazine. Slippery slope present and highlighted https://t.co/fkfjyNgtz9
@KevinShau Your using Pool repeatedly as an example of an intellectual is laughable. He won an unrecognizable award(same award was given to Epic Meal Time and Justin Bieber)
He also was named Time person solely for live streaming an event on twitter. Hardly prestige earning
@KevinShau It's an analysis based in fact. 
Ben Carson is a neurosurgeon, naming his degree and job doesn't excuse his misinformation.
@KevinShau Most of the alt right agrees with him.
I do my research well, I am very thorough and I would not make claims without being able to back them up, albeit it is tough in 150 characters
@KevinShau https://t.co/QoRJ0L9JdL
Please do read this, keeping in mind it's an opinion piece
@KevinShau Peterson is sexist and at the very least probably islamophoboc. He argues using common logical fallacies, mostly the "slippery slope" fallacy, it's prevent in almost all of his arguments
@KevinShau Peterson preys on disaffected young men, sets up encounters with people not formally educated in his field and slants the setting so he appears intelligent to angry people incapable of doing independent research.
@KevinShau Peterson is arguing conflicting points with conflicting data and poor sources, but it works on those who can not research independently and rely on the hive mind of the alt-right. (despite disowning the label)
@KevinShau He sources Reddit, then says freer partners equals less violence with a shoddy source that also implies celibacy is even more nonviolent. That directly contradicts the other point that celibacy creates violence
@KevinShau I'd also question the Forced Monogomy Peterson proposes as a solution. That seems a lot like forcing a lifestyle choice, from how it reads

@KevinShau Government should not discriminate, legislation would be necessary to prevent it
@KevinShau Yet Trump did
@KevinShau Historically this has always been the case
@KevinShau So let's allow people to be discriminated against?
Fix the politics, correct the legislation
@KevinShau Again, define terms and prepare legislation.
Don't say oh well it confuses me so let's let these people suffer discrimination
@KevinShau So, it hasn't happened.

Instead of working to define these terms, throw it all out the window? No thank you
@KevinShau That's is a false analogy, I'm not sure what your point would be here
@KevinShau When has that happened? And don't mention Canada because we have discussed that isn't what the law is
@KevinShau Can you provide evidence? I'd argue it was on the decline slowly and the legislation speeded up the decline
@KevinShau A transgender person is an individual, the protection for their person is also for their group
@KevinShau Though most do, currently is it impossible for others to outwardly identify outside those two. And those who do are able to be treated differently with no repercussions, including but not limited to employment, housing and legally
@KevinShau Most biological males also identify as straight, so we should have no minorities for the protection of sexual preference?
@KevinShau Another humans gender identity affects you in no wsy. Forcing them to narrow theirs down to once of two is unnecessary and wrong
@KevinShau You're thinking of biological sex
@KevinShau I trust a group of well informed and educated people more than the mass population.
@KevinShau Shaming a gender is worse
@KevinShau Slippery slope fallacy, you're better than that.
You aren't legislating subconscious, you're legislating the force of applying gender roles on others and legislation preventing discrimination on those who have gender roles that aren't your own. Give a step stool to those who need
@KevinShau And yes I am aware it is an oversimplification but I feel it helps
@KevinShau And that is outside the rest of the facts in that case
@KevinShau Ignore the science. A woman you work with had an abortion, and then you circulate a memo saying they killed their baby. You aren't fired because you said something arguably factual, but for creating a hostile work environment for them
@KevinShau There is a large difference between a sage space and a non hostile work environment.
Spewing blatant sexist garbage is a hostile work environment
@KevinShau Damore was, at least partially, fired for creating a hostile work environment by falsely claiming women were not equipped for the job, and circulating that message to employees
@KevinShau This video was to show the bosses of parents and the idea that we subconsciously place gender roles on others
@KevinShau Nobody wants to force someone to act in a way that doesn't match their gender, people want to keep society from forcing gender roles onto others.
@KevinShau Then you should do basic research
@KevinShau  https://t.co/vTAuboAy4g
@KevinShau James Damore got fired for being an idiot
https://t.co/0iZPuPV2nG
@KevinShau https://t.co/Ly27jPg6aa
@KevinShau I wouldn't argue that we need to destroy traditional gender roles, but get rid of the systemic sexism that helps leave them in place
@KevinShau I'll link you to monkeys throwing shit at eachother too
@KevinShau Traditional gender roles are breaking free naturally already, just slowly. All I want to do is loosen the chains. Help the progress rather than hinder it.
@KevinShau I agree on the first half, the second half is because they are being bred that way, with the EZ-bake oven, Barbie, Disney princess childhood, the home-ec schooling and the pushing by people who grew up in a much stronger patriarchal society that is becoming increasingly outdated
@KevinShau We have to make those careers friendly to women. Look at the percentage of women who report abuse in STEM fields, then recognize that many do not report out of fear of retaliation. Look at the percentage of STEM field applicants to graduates, and recognize that those are related
@KevinShau Because from a young age women aren't pushed into the idea that being housewives is a fine goal? That women should cook, clean and be mothers? There is data on the systemic sexism that does exist.
@KevinShau Women are more likely to do housework, but that isn't systemic? Are you high?
@KevinShau I'm on my phone in a car but that is stuff you can google or I can google for you when I'm near my desktop
@KevinShau When those are accounted for a large gap still exists. The exact portion of percent is just Semantics.
@KevinShau The gap takes into account most of those factors if not all. Even when accounted for, a gap still exists. Pretending otherwise is ignorant and dangerous
@KevinShau I’ve watched his videos on the wage gap, when it is verifiable, he calls it a myth and says women choose not to be successful and are poor leaders, who would rather have a faster microwave than a furthered career.
@KevinShau Let's not Use the term journalist so frivolously
