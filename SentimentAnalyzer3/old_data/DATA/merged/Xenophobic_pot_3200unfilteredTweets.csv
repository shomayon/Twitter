@NUH__XD @DaxDoesShit @Mikasacus Ah I didn't know you were joking lol I agree with you with lyn being a good character and my not be optimal as a unit but can do some niche strats and her mani katti is basically rapier 2.0 since she's force deploy on the last chapter might as well use her to contribute there
@DaxDoesShit @NUH__XD @Mikasacus You count the royal families as lords? Ehh I guess? I prefer lyn because of he character and thighs it's a shame that she's not much a part of the game storywise. I think Camilla is alrightish characterwise, just need to tone down her obsession for corrin a bit
