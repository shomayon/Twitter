@Conservative_JA But there is no election! She needs to sail the shop through Brexit and then about a year before next election go, probably to someone who isn‚Äôt currently in cabinet or certainly not senior role so that they have a fresh start. You need to look back at opinion polls and trends

Things that I‚Äôm called by people who have mostly only just met me.... annoying, try hard, too loud, full of herself, weird, odd. Things that I am..kind, fun, generous, funny (sometimes) chatty, smily, enthusiastic #adhd #adultadhd #walkinmyshoes
Themselves to care about mental health issues look a little harder at themselves and maybe judge those you meet a little less in the future. #adhd #adultadhd
People tell you to ignore it but every single time this has happened my confidence has been eroded until I have been left in a dark place of depression and anxiety. I hope people who tell me to stop trying to hard (I‚Äôm not this is me all the time!) or to shut up yet consider
Makes me a bit hyperactive and I talk a lot. Yet these crimes have led to ppl telling me I wasn‚Äôt welcome in a new town i moved to, that I wasn‚Äôt welcome at a new hobby I took up, that I need to shut up when singing songs at a sports game, to sniggering when I walk into a room..
THREAD.. mental health awareness is not about copying and posting something on Fb but living and breathing it everyday in the way you act. All my adult life I‚Äôve had trouble from people going out of their way to tell me they don‚Äôt like me. My only crime seems to be that my #ADHD

@magpies_history I was 12. Went with my Dad. All standing behind the goal when it went in. I wish I could have appreciated then how special it was. You can see me and my dad in the crowd when he scored.
@Zeitgeist24_7 If oz spend the next year losing he will be welcomed back with open arms. Bancroft will have to hope they don‚Äôt find a decent opener!
As an England cricket team fan it‚Äôs time to let the Aussies get on with it and focus on why we haven‚Äôt won away since 2016.
@Zeitgeist24_7 Yes. I did start to wonder if the world had gone a little crazy at this point. There does need to be some perspective. He hasn‚Äôt killed anyone, he‚Äôs not in the same league as say Lance Armstrong
@Zeitgeist24_7 And why did they say it was sticky tape and not sandpaper? Did they think this sounded better?
And as a newer country their sporting achievements gives them a place on the world stage. They are also very patriotic and defensive of their country. This will have hurt proper Aussie cricket fans.
I should add I love Australia, I lived in Queensland and if they made planes faster and would have me I would happily live there forever. The reason they outperform their size at sport isn‚Äôt just because of the weather but because as a country they love their sport
@Zeitgeist24_7 I just sort of want to think Smith wasn‚Äôt that involved. He has always seemed a decent person to me but maybe you are right.
Things don‚Äôt go there way. From what I understand just like in other sports cricketers get together after the sport had finished and enjoy the company of the opposition except when playing Oz!
Ok one more thing. If we accept that Lehmann wasn‚Äôt involved surely he has to accept some blame for the culture that saw the team thrive on being hated. The Millwall of cricket. The Ashes will always be spicy yet oz seem to make enemies everywhere they go and then complain when..
@Zeitgeist24_7 Have to wait 10 years for the autobiographies to know more!
@Zeitgeist24_7 Sure, and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs why his punishment was less. But why go along with Warner of all people. I‚Äôm trying to imagine a new player in England team in 2011 choosing KP over the rest of the team. Is there deeper issues in the changing room or was Bancroft really that daft...
Different to 2011. England players couldn‚Äôt relax off the pitch and midnight curfew was introduced. They even laughed along with the Barmy Army realising it‚Äôs harder for fans to target players M Johnson style when they seem to be enjoying it. They just showed no weakness.
Finally I thought Australia were amazing off the field during the Ashes. They would have always won but they got inside the England players heads, whilst they looked composed and with eyes on the prize England were spending their time defending their culture which was no..
I don‚Äôt understand why Bancroft would decide to align himself with Warner. All too strange #sandpapergate
Only Warner was missing I noticed how close knit they were. Of course they were happy but they seemed comfortable together. Also Smith was totally in control, he ushered them around the casino. When he moved the whole team went too. He was totally in charge. This is again why...
All the team were there including a few wives except for WARNER. They soon realised who we were but the vibe was generally positive and a few players asked us to sing some songs and had a laugh with us. Smith and his wife were there and Bancroft was there too. As well as noting..
On the night Oz won the Ashes I was with Barmy Army in Perth Casino. As it was past midnight this was the only place open in Perth and only one bar was open in there. Soon after arriving at the bar the Aussie team arrived, they had been having a meal and were staying there...
@kevina364 He is their KP.
He only cares about no1 and maybe the abuse had finally got to him. I know I‚Äôm supposed to hate Smith but I just feel sad, he was a machine during the ashes, whatever he does for the rest of his career it will always be overshadowed now, he had the chance to be a great.
Care if the ball swings? He‚Äôs not bowling and none of the abuse has been personally aimed at him. Let‚Äôs say Warner did come to him with this plan surely telling your Captain and teammates is going to help your standing more esp when it was Warner idea! Warner is the KP of Aus..
My #sandpapergate thoughts for anyone who cares. I don‚Äôt get why Bancroft did it if it just came from Warner? Bancroft is new to the team, playing for his place and trying to find his place in the dressing room. So why ally with the least popular person? Also why does he
I really want Macc to get promoted. That is a horrid league to get out of and they have one of the smallest budgets and most of the club is run by fans. I loved my time at the club. #mtfc
.@GerritForward I didn‚Äôt see last promotion season. How does this team compare? 97/98 team were very special. They had such confidence it felt like we would never lose again
I‚Äôve got to that age where I realise how much education is wasted on the young and how much I would love the chance to study politics or my a levels again. Still I did have fun back then!

@AdelaideBarmies We also have areas with 2nd gen Indian children who do love the game (huge numbers turn out when India are in town) but we have had little success in finding players
@AdelaideBarmies I do think football having huge academies sweeping all sporty boys up at 6 is bad for all other sports too. Parents suddenly think their 6 yr old is the next Ronaldo and other sports aren‚Äôt even thought about
@TheAshes1011 That draw was amazing. I saw England win the ashes at trent bridge but that draw was the most tense I‚Äôve ever been at a cricket game!!
@daznccc Bet Broady was happy about that one
@ZaltzCricket So we didn‚Äôt even set any more records?!?
@AdelaideBarmies Agreed. Sky have been good for the game but we need some t20 at least on regular tv
Nothing else compares. NZ is a tiny population compared to Eng and it‚Äôs not their number 1 sport. So yes we should expect to beat NZ and if we aren‚Äôt doing we need a massive rethink as a country about how we keep cricket as our no2 sport. #NZvsEng
No longer seem to. It‚Äôs not just a middle class sport like in England and they don‚Äôt have football academy that snap up any sporty 6 yr old and make their focus just football. But when I lived in NZ I rarely met a Kiki who cared about cricket, rugby is a way of life there and
Some thoughts for what they are worth... When I lived in Oz I *got* why they were good at cricket. Head to any park and see little kids playing the game, they aspire to be cricketters. T20 is on regular tv and the average Aussie seems to love the game in a way the English....

@Minhosa27 For them to have real chance at other sport
@Minhosa27 Also noticed in oz (ok if was summer there) that there were kids everywhere just playing cricket, on the park, beach etc. Don‚Äôt see that over here. Also with football academy starting at 6 they are taking all the sporty kids in and then dropping them later when too late....
@Minhosa27 Yeah fresh eyes! Im worried about new T20, it doesn‚Äôt take into account the differences between U.K. and oz like the weather!!
Only slightly good thing (clutching at straws) about England test team not being great ATM is maybe people will have a bit more respect for some of the players achievements over previous years. Too many people take Swanny, Cook, Anderson type players for granted

@twomuch77 Well in America for example you can go direct to a specialist rather than through a GP. in Australia you can see a GP 24/7 but you pay for the privilege. We need to look at all ideas and be open to change
What tv shows do you watch again and again? Mine is the office (American version!) god knows how many times I‚Äôve seen it!
@twomuch77 I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just about money. It‚Äôs about changing the whole way we use the service. I‚Äôm not necessary against money being raised through taxation I just think it‚Äôs an issue that no one can have an adult conversation about without ppl screaming that we are moving to US
@twomuch77 Exactly! We need to have that conversation. We have to pay more one way or another!
At last someone talking sense about the NHS. Stop talking about America and talk about European systems!! #thisweek
I am a woman, a conservative and a feminist. We need to stop the left using this word as their own. I want every woman born in the U.K. to grow up believing they can do whatever they want in life from being a doctor, engineer or a grid girl. That is true feminism to me.
The best way to get more women into politics is to stop the stupid late hours that the commons hold. How can anyone have a family and want to work those hours.

Going to watch Notts together again just like we should be. #notts
Notts do. My Dad also stopped going 10 years ago. Tonight, I went to his and we sat and watched the game together, chatting, ranting and generally being annoyed at Notts. It felt amazing to do that again and I know now it won‚Äôt be long until we are both
I worked for the club 10 years ago and it didn‚Äôt end well. In fact it ended up with me utterly broken and falling out of love with the club. I‚Äôve tried for a long time to get it back and it‚Äôs been so hard. Finally this season I am feeling it again and caring how
Something good about tonight... I started watching Notts in 1991 when I was 10. Me and my dad going to every home game and the odd away game together. Having that time with my dad was amazing, especially as one of 5 as time alone was harder to come by. As some ppl know
Fair play to Notts fans who sang all game. That mentality isn‚Äôt always there in football anymore and it was great to see #notts
Sometimes I feel sad that my best years of watching Notts was when I was 9 - 14 and didn‚Äôt really appreciate it but then I remember we have fans who have only ever seen us in the bottom 2 divisions after years of watching us #notts
Well focusing on the league is important and we did make some decent money. We have to get out of this league.

RT @emilypttrsn: does a black and white striped top count as lights or darks https://t.co/tE9ZBVtPk1
As a party we need to focus on 30somethings not 18 year olds who will never vote for us

A young man who isn‚Äôt a socialist hasn‚Äôt got a heart; an old man who is a socialist hasn‚Äôt got a head.
Oh and remove the fine for taking children out of school during term time (up to year 9) Leave it to the discretion of the school. The current policy shows little understanding how important family time is and what it is like for the average person to get time off during summer
10. Overall strive to be the party of a fairer society, one that lets the brightest reach the top and doesnt punish people who have done well in life. #tories #Conservatives
9. Stop talking about the internet like something you have just discovered / been told about . Everytime I hear a Tory MP discuss the internet I cringe.
8. Might seem petty but remove subsided bars / food from parliament. We need to regrow trust in our MPs and things like this just wind people up!
7. See prison as a way to rehabilitate rather than simply punish, how can we lock (mostly) men in cells for 23 hours a day and then send them back into the community with ¬£30 and expect them to not re-offend! Gove had amazing ideas in this area
6. Ban the export of live animals and increase the punishment for people found to be mistreating animals (life time ban should be the norm!)
5. Consumer rights need to be updated and tightened as we allow too many online rogue traders that you wouldn't see in your local shopping centre.
4. Re look at the system for house buying, buying houses in England is far more difficult than any other western country. The system needs to change.
3. As less people can afford to buy look at better rights for both tenants and landlords. Good landlords and tenants need to be treated better and rogue landlords should have banning orders / more severe punishment.
should work with local primary schools to reach out to families with gifted children (whether academic, sports, the arts) and to offer them places.  

Encourage more scholarships and grants at University, similar to in America where students can apply for all sorts of funds
Better schools are helping with this but we must do more. Lets keep Uni fees but reintroduce grants for the poorest when studying certain subjects.

Private schools school keep their charitable status but must admit a higher percentage of children on 100% subsidies, the schools
part of the scheme. Filling farm positions in Australia is easy because you have to do farm work to get a 2nd year visa. 

2. I want us to be the party of aspiration, whatever the circumstances you are born in to, I want children to be able to reach their full potential
to those who voted to leave. At the same time we need to open up schemes to ensure we still have the workforce required for our economy to keep growing. For example extend the working holiday scheme to 2 years and offer to all EU countries and other countries currently not
So here goes tonight's long political rant for anyone interested...

As a party our first priority has to be Brexit and to get it right, this means exiting the customs union and taking back control of immigration, to think that people voted for something else is patronising
I am not a huge Theresa May fan, shes fine but doesn't exactly inspire me. But I want her to stay on as leader whilst Brexit is sorted and until we get Ruth Davidson into Parliament and she is the only person I can see as the next leader and next PM #tories #conservatives

@NottsAde What a joke mate. Have noticed the exec boxes are the poor man of hospitality
sport. That if you haven't place a bet on a Saturday whilst watching sport you aren't doing it right.
Thanks to these experiences I now want much stricter regulations within the gambling industry from lowering the max spin bet to removing ATMs from bingo halls and to make self exclusion a lot simpler. We also need to break this idea that gambling now comes hand in hand with
feel you are one more spin away from winning. Smoking might kill you over a long period but gambling can ruin your life in a day. Although I believe in free choice I also dont like how the gambling industry preys on those that have the least and who need money the most.
Secondly, having run a small matched betting company I learnt so much about the betting industry and what I see I really dont like. We have to have plain packaging on fags to help people give up smoking yet slot machines are made specifically to make you gamble more, to make you
The system also discriminates against home owners, trust me it makes you wish you just rented a property and hadnt made the decision to save and to buy a house.
For example I received a letter from the council declining my application for council tax relief. The letter doesn't give me a reason, in fact it tells me I need to write in if I want to know why!!! A frustrating task if you weren't ill but a lot tougher when you are.
2 examples of where my views are developing and changing thanks to personal experience. I am currently not able to work due to illness, and have had to go through the process of claiming ESA. By doing this I have understood what a frustrating and difficult process this is
experiences will help them in making decisions for the country rather than hinder them.
