missing the past &amp; not loving the future, i can't tell who it's destroying
i kinda get sad when people expect the old me now
it's a whole new energy
cause i got more to do
more to think about
if that i just be on naps
thinking into exhaustion is the only sleep i get
time means everything &amp; nothing at the same time to me
so busy dealing with life
&lt;3 what we got won't ever change though trust.
we caught each other at bad times
actions self validate
you don't gotta verbally validate yourself to me
i know the storms coming.
pray it's not my last
this really might be my 1st life
life unfolding like foretold &amp; it's heartbreaking
somebody offer me a deal &amp; u can have it.
Love too toxic

even for myself
only if i could sell my love in exchange for my values 

&lt;/3
Maybe i worded that wrong
if only i could sell my soul for my love...

even at my lowest I've never come close to your circumstances
it's the small things that separate us and those "small" things happen to be big factors
never compare someone's else's life to your own, cuz neither could ever come close.
my attempt to help was flawed but at least I ain't sit there &amp; watch
as if it's just me though
I know my next steps
now that I'm out da super slum, I got the priorities straight
im just trynna get my bands back up for my boo
I'll be the bad guy if that's what it takes

all I want from anyone
a lot say it's bigger den what it is but its watever I keep shit moving
it's a lot of things I let slide, things I'm still hurt from till this day but I don't have time to dwell on small stuff
Living lies will eat you alive, I always come clean.
hate me with your soul but remember what was done, full circle.
im not afraid to own up to my mistakes, I'll tell the world and not be ashamed
i need tax season to steady swing by

regardless of what was damaged I hope we all found some motivation from this and learned something
