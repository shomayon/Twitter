HEY GUYS FYI I'VE TAKEN ART HISTORY AND BUDDHIST LITERATURE CLASSES AT UNI.

PLEASE CLAP.
this concept of an imperfect, subjective, spontaneous expression isn't unique to eastern art. this idea was explored significantly in western art (notably abstract expressionism). you see it in Barnett Newman's "zips" and Jackson Pollock's overall method of painting. https://t.co/5pIUufvw0w
some examples of wabi-sabi in zen  ☸️🗾: https://t.co/zLGTaPTtnT
It is a process of silencing the mind and thus removing the suffering of your own condition, removing the "self" and tapping into the insight that comes with detachment. but you are still just as human and must carry out the dharma for the rest of your mortal experience https://t.co/LlhKBSd7oD
zen buddhism also has a concept I really like known as "wabi-sabi". it is the embrace of the ephemeral nature of all things and the imperfections of the human experience. enlightenment doesn't mean you're suddenly infallible, you still proceed as a mortal being with flaws ☸️
you see this a lot in zen buddhism. there is an effort or lack thereof, to have this feeling of spontaneity and clarity within daily life. you see it with the way gongs resonate, or the intuitive, uninhibited creation of an ensō and in other rituals
this is sort of the nature of the phenomenon of the epiphany. it is a momentary grasp of a lucid, revelatory, transcendent experience. but like all things, it is ephemeral. you wake up the next day, losing a part of it, proceeding as usual. suchness is about preserving that sense
It is only when we become attached to expectations or external conceptions that by nature limit us or make us smaller that we slip out of that enlightenment. In that sense it is something you can slip in and out of. If all we have is the present, you can be enlightened NOW 😉🌌
I forgot which sect(s) it is but in some form of Buddhism ☸️ there is the idea that everyone -- by default -- is already a buddha, already enlightened. You can see this with children--what they lack in knowledge they make up for in spiritual unattachment
⚕🆙 https://t.co/yBTPgsgPHb
https://t.co/kspTz9M8wj
https://t.co/u1ZyKQOBWY
if you just see "god" as everything both within u and in relation to u as opposed to an omnipresent external judge this becomes a lot easier to process
it's not that there was a specific person with a divine experience it's that we collectively chose to reinforce that idea and maintain it long enough over the course of history for it to be normalized.
Or idk that's just an idea. I mean think of how we give religious iconography strength and how faith and perceived cause-effect connections strengthen the impact of those religions.... 🤔
If we live in a world of mental energy and symbols and internalization, maybe if there is enough of a proliferation of an idea (i.e. boomers dying from heart attacks) that is signified culturally, that will begin to manifest more physically. It's all about the strength of belief
pls retweet https://t.co/1TMMY81mh8
I was in much more of a flow then so my transcendent subjective reality began to overlap more with the more mundane objective reality. It seems like whatever mass hysteria I sensed then had kind of died down a bit.
I gotta say my external reality certainly has changed significantly since I started posting again in Fall, especially during Winter, at least on the level of collective consciousness expansion or shifting
maybe I'll just continue to subversively divert the ontological norms enough until my external reality presents me with a system that doesn't feel so stacked against me
do you ever think you might actually be more successful being a cult leader than actually getting the career of your dreams?

I honestly think the main motivating factor is that people like having the power using language and cultural norms to completely destroy someone. They love the suffering. They even love the suffering caused to the person's friends and loved ones.

These are not good people.
there's a difference between preventing a legitimately problematic person from having a platform and combing through a person's worst moments because you have a sociopathic desire for revenge against people you don't like
the majority of what an "activist" spends their emotional energy on feeding into online says a lot more about their character than what they claim to stand for. these people are chumps and they maintain the 24 hour news cycle of shit. destroy them.
Not everyone has to be fired for [offensive thing]. Theres no moral obligation or imperative, it's merely a status quo snowball effect. These arent morally upright individuals, they're the same people who were drama queens in high school, all they care about is watching downfalls
Reminder: the left invented wishy washy inconsistent performative outrage, the right adopted it as a tit-for-tat thing and just really suck at it because their liberal "gotcha" counter examples are usually devoid of context.

@3hrist what are the evil ones? 🤔
Historical revisionism. Plain and simple. The more we recognize propaganda as legitimate the more we're changing the legacy of American imperialism by absolving and softening crimes against humanity. It's appalling and more people should be upset.
We're trying to give war criminals the benefit of the doubt with retroactive praise via the mainstream media. You see it with the Bush family, you see it with the Clintons, you see it with liberal establishment darlings, you see it with the same neocon ghouls who've lingered

Also why the fuck are we giving Obama a netflix series? We willingly lose paradise more and more every year. Why is HBO releasing a propaganda documentary on McCain just as he's about to croak? Does this not seem weird to anyone else?
Think of the impact technology and mass entertainment has had on re-wiring the brains of gen z. They live in a fundamentally warped view of the world.
Stop making shitty people famous. Stop making fame seem more important than it is. Reinstill the values that promote a healthy family unit or we'll continue to have parents who raise fuck up reactionary failchildren who resort to murder for attention.
In a world where sociopaths aren't given attention they'd rather take a legacy of infamy than no legacy at all. And honestly given how the media chooses to cover and oversaturate certain stories we really have no one but ourselves to blame. It's a byproduct of consumer culture.
honestly I think we have the media and entertainment culture to blame for the current political climate and to a large extent the school shooter epidemic. give attention to the wrong things, laud the wrong people, celebrate trash culture and it'll be reflected beyond reality TV

The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards the people who have consolidated totalitarian power over institutions and information.
The idea of a "media class" that is just a more detached solipsistic extension of liberal urbanite elitism  is awful and provides nothing of value to the common people. Its more misinformation than information, miscommunication than communication.
journalism has become more about ingroup pandering than content
It's no longer even about trying to convince people to agree to a point, it's about proving to the people who already agree with you that you're right. What a fucking joke.
How long in general until people in general realize that they're just spinning wheels and pissing off the opposition with no net gain for either side?

progress is relative but it's felt somewhat stagnant lately
what makes something interesting or novel or powerful is the context in which it is used. if you're just doing madlibs "for the culture" like it's just a catchphrase because you wanted to seem different it loses all impact and often comes across as forced or corny 💯
Weird facebook creators have more honor because they're mostly putting out OC and creating their own little recurring jokes and storylines.

Twitter is just about aping whatever thing is cool and trying to convince yourself that you're a comedian/woke/politically aware
also I don't take credit for changing -ight into -ite in most instances but I certainly used it frequently enough that other people adopted it. 

Language is weird.

Manufactured outrage. Performative righteousness. Educated white people speaking on behalf of others. The liberal arts became so politicized in the worst ways at the expense of exploration, discussion, and debate
It's important how you frame an issue or how society has set the discourse on how to debate/discuss it, especially with the changes in "social justice" methods in the last 5 years.
I think shifts in narrative are often more disgusting than the issues those narratives represent
It's not so much abortion itself that irks me, it's the shift in attitude that has followed it in the last ~5 years or so. Really crass and immature. Stop celebrating your lack of accountability.
how did we go from "abortion is a woman's choice" to "if I could have an abortion I would" or "yeah, ive had several abortions because of my own lack of responsibility but I'm proud of all of them"
Morally bankrupt individuals that lot, peformative sacrilege for the sake of performative sacrilege
I can understand wanting to distance yourself from Catholicism but to mock nature and spirit in the name of narcissistic hedonism, etc. is so off-putting 

I don't know how anyone can have the arrogance to see themselves as above nature or the forces beyond our perception
My buddhism shares aspects with agnosticism in the sense of an unknown regarding God but fucking hell I generally hate atheists
I'm relatively neutral on the 8th amendment thing but god damn does it bring the worst out of people (left and right)

the elites already have access to methods of prolonging their lives, imagine what'll happen when they have cybernetic somatic modifications which make them more powerful than the rest of us mere humans

the technology will exist but it will only be accessible to the ultra-rich
they are summoning otherworldly forces into our own https://t.co/7ndf0f5rsb
I wouldn't really consider myself a neo-luddite but I think we have reached a point in history where further technological advances have far more sinister applications which serve to further class disparity rather than to resolve fundamental global issues
1 issue I have with the suggestion that technological advancements are analogous to societal 'progress' is often that the zealotry of technocrats has us diving into realms of the dark and unknown faster than we can assess the psychological and sociological effects of that novelty
I'm not sure people have assessed the extent and consequences of hyperbranding and the market of self

Or are we gonna have to keep kissing ass and doing it "their way" until they all die off and we come up with better systems to hire and pay young people with creative endeavors?
Is there any process of 'getting a real job' that isn't an outdated and monotonous chore?
Also I fucking hate email shmoozing and googling shit, I need a career mentor or something
Seriously, I would like to get paid to do word things but as someone with no formal experience in that sort of work environment I have no idea what I should be doing rn. A lot of it seems like a fruitless endeavor but idk how this industry works right now....
Serious question: is self-publishing articles/essays on Medium actually an effective and productive way to actually be on the road to paid writing work? Because these scoopty doops writing these stinkpieces are embarrassing yo
I've already been diagnosed and there are universal qualities associated with people like me. Just because you can't understand something doesn't mean it doesn't exist lol. Bro, like have you even listened to Pet Sounds? Or read any Poe? FOH nerd.
Also, like as someone with bipolar, idk there's a lot there to unpack but yeah my mind works differently than yours. Arguably in more complex and abstract ways. Mans is just upset that he's dumb. The parallel between madness and genius has been explored to death esp w literature
2018: Hipster neurotypicals disregarding context for performative in-group brownie points and self-aggrandizement
The people who are denoted as geniuses by contemporary society are often given that status after that person has already become successful via either business or academia. It's retroactive. Clout. A reflection of that person's perceived success. Completely different.
I'd say that capitalism doesn't reward genius, it rewards the byproduct of genius that is palatable enough for the masses or has appeal that doesn't require the same mind as the creator. Genius more often exists at the margins, in cramped middling apartments, psych wards
It also suggests that genius is a product of society or history and not of the mind of an individual. How society perceives or ranks a figure has nothing to do with that individual's objective ability. https://t.co/Dn7lmA0NYh
All of these arguments are pulled out of thin air and poorly explained. Rubbish. No scientific or historical context whatsoever. Perfectly illustrates the myopia of the current culture. We've accelerated so much these clowns can't remember life before 2016.

Lol I'm just bullshitting. I just think it's a cool topic and we need more rugged individuals right now. shit sucks and eyes are on everyone, the internet's wild west days are long gone. Ideologies have been manufactured and adopted by didactic syndicates

Which way Western man?
by no means is he fully disciplined or even a stable figure; he will imbibe, gamble, fornicate, perhaps even steal or murder. survival is the primary undercurrent in his being, and in a lawless society he will do anything to preserve it. and still a lingering desperation,
in molding himself he sees no need to trust the hearsay of the commoners, and, with nothing to gain, finds no pleasure in their never-ending charades. a loner. satisfaction stems from the fruits of his labor, the weight of his presence, self-reliance, wisdom through experience
as an archetype, his individualism and self-preservation makes him an iconoclast. he sneers at the state, the creeping of corrupt hierarchy to the west. confident in his autonomy he discards ideals imposed by the external forces of man. opportunity pulls him, uncertainty awakens
the cowboy is a vagabond, an icon of rugged individualism, a man surrounded in all directions by frontier. he answers only to his instinct. he is weathered by toil and vigilance. solitude revitalizes him, brings him closer to nature. death always near, looming at the horizon.

Its a lot easier to process &amp; understand an experience someone else is describing if u have already experienced it. It's also a lot more intuitive if that's the case. And I've experienced things that over 95% of people never will. There will always be that phenomenological lacuna
a lot of people don't understand the spiritual concept of surrender or what it entails or how it unfolds in the greater process of awakening

surrender is dope, I wish I could share my subjective perception because obviously language has limitations or people don't understand

You know yourself more than anyone else does
Y'all ever heard of uhhhhhhhhhhhh, the "Godhead"? 

See yourself more as a vessel and less as a self.
Also a lot of people don't trust their intuition enough. They'll stay in a toxic place or with toxic people despite that being a huge factor in feeling distressed. It takes courage to listen to your mind and body and follow through
I'm more content now than I probably have ever been because most external factors don't phase me like they used to. The energy I'm not wasting ruminating or worrying about a self in some competitive psychodrama has kept me in a creative flow
There's a difference between "following your dreams" for external fulfillment or material gain and being content with yourself and your own unfolding. Lot of people spiritually bankrupt, they do things differently than I do for different reasons &amp; motivations
I'm a neet now and I'm fine with it because I'm still planning and organizing things so I can tackle them head on with a better sense of clarity, knowledge and foresight.
if someone is a neet and they're happy let em be, people always tryna project their life accomplishments onto you like you're gonna have the same 1:1 experience they had or do things at the same pace as them, it's annoying

Stop toying with suffering people unless you like to see their self-worth errode. Fuck you, you know who you are.
Even when it's another person's life that was lost they still find away to be selfish or fake. Fuck you, you're the reason those people felt so helpless in the first place.
Some people are so callous. Even if someone suffering commits suicide they'll say stuff like "you don't know what grief you cause to people you left behind" or pretend to care about mental illness for a week performatively. Despite being shitty to that person while they lived.

Like for real cut me a fucking break, would you have been happier if I hung myself in 2013?
People have no idea what I've had to endure or how hard I've had to push to just make it out alive now. Nor will they ever care or bother to find out.
I just talked with my therapist hence this random tangent. For something more light-hearted I rated Pee five stars https://t.co/PhsGQOvD1V
Ignorance is bliss
I just wish more people could see what I see, think how I think. I'm so beyond so much of this trash that keeps people down.
And even the DIY route still involves putting up with other people's egos and people shitting on you for approaching life differently and having a vision that actually pushes things in a different direction
It's not that I don't want I job, it's that I don't like feeling like I have to beg and fit arbitrary checkmarks for competence when I feel like what I offer far exceeds that.
Hence why my career path is so difficult. Especially with bipolar. I exist on a different plane of reality than other people and I know and am aware of so much and it's incredibly alienating to even talk to other people, it always feels like there's something missing
In case anyone is wondering my biggest fears are rejection, failure and not feeling good enough despite my talents, like I always having to prove myself for basic acceptance and recognition of competence

This is one problem with giving the authority for primary sources to very select publications because these publications will abuse that power to write history as they see fit. This is a fundamental problem with historicity
Keep this in mind when you see the NYT, WaPo, NBC, CBS etc frame the current situation in Gaza with deliberate tactics like framing, passive voice and distancing, especially with today's front page of the NYT. We are seeing revisionist history in real time
"the NYT plays an enormous role in shaping the perception of the current world on the part of the politically active educated classes...and I believe that NYT editors bear a heavy burden in the sense that the NYT creates history" - Noam Chomsky

https://t.co/opNr1ONrUU
Isnt it a bit odd that the media &amp; oafish elites threw a bigger fit about Michelle Wolf's correspondence dinner speech than literally any of the war escalation and massacres of Palestinians in the past several weeks? We need a revolution in journalism.
My grammar was all over the place in those tweets but I hope what I said made sense
How much do you see Trump being used as a target instead of legitimately more terrifying tactics used by the GOP like ramping up ICE, or reversing climate change/environmental protection policy, or enacting policy that further consolidates elite wealth

https://t.co/6x3StGagxh
It's not so much that Trump is that paper tiger it's that the media focuses so much on trivial one upsmanship. Liberals care more about proving everyone else wrong with an elitist mentality than actually doing anything to combat the looming spectre of fascism
If they have a paper tiger they can always prop up to distract from whats going on behind the scenes. You see time and time again in American history fear in conjunction with the media used to create artificial antagonism and diversion
Then again I am still shocked daily by how ignorant and gullible the American public is, especially when they aren't challenged to question their political parties. Boomer libs just cling onto what they have for years and still provides them a sense of comfort
It seems that Obama/Clinton had reason to ally with the deep state, primarily for continuation and consolidation of power and it backfired. I find it hard to believe that the pro-intelligence agency, pro-Russia narrative position pushed by the MSM is still convincing to people

The cyclical nature of addiction and mental illness is really sad, especially you see the destruction it wreaks, especially if the person grew up in a fucked up situation.
This was back in like 2012/13 btw when I was off the rails
So it went almost from a compulsion to just a normal extension of my character. Empathy is good.
It sorta started when I had mania and would walk around at like 3 in the morning in sketchy areas of downtown but I really don't mind talking to or even chilling for a bit with homeless people. They are a lot more wise than people realize
Well that was kind of a weird experience but I'm glad I stuck around to talk to the guy. It's really hard for the homeless especially in Seattle, a lot of people don't realize all the things they have to do just to survive and stay safe.

I think gay people are chill I just don't like the idea of "the LGBT community" being this monolithic thing with a political agenda that prescribes specific principles. Plus echo chamber SJW communities like "cool freaks" on Facebook really shone a light on toxicity in that realm

Because if "online as hell" or whatever people as opposed to people who just follow friends feel like they have the right to dish out shit they should be able to take it too. It's only fair.
And I'm mostly talking in person to strangers or people you meet at parties or on the street or whatever. I think having a public Twitter account sorta puts everyone on a level playing field for dunking on people
It's weird to me how being kind outwardly to people isn't the default for some. It's just as easy as being snide or passive aggressive, probably even easier since it takes less effort and thinking. But Seattle gonna be Seattle. The city operates on lies and put-downs
Sometimes I wonder if certain people I know have said more behind my back, obsessing behind the scenes than they've ever interacted with me directly. Im sure there's a handful of people I know like that. That's some weirdo shit.
when you're depressed and get ghosted it makes you feel sub-human. all because a person didn't want to do a basic respectful thing

All of these unwritten rules instilled by how Facebook rewired our brains just made us more miserable. Zuckerberg is a fucking cockroach. The net effect of all this artificial dopamine and instant gratification has been awful for interpersonal behavior both on and offline
So many things would not be problems if people were okay with explaining or asking to clarify. People read way too much into such trivial things. Double texting? Who cares, just talk
But instead people see something, turn it into drama, gossip, backstab when it all could have been a misconception you took the wrong way. Such a toxic way of living your life.
It's okay to like actually call up your friends you know. Like catching up with them, seeing what they're up to, just being a friend, having a conversation. But nah, yall care more about flexing on Instagram stories than actually supporting people worth caring about.
So much pain all around from assumptions just because everyone is too weak to communicate like people with other people.

Basically selling out has consequences. Idk ever heard of Faust?
You people criticize Trump for being in office yet you perpetuate a sort of hyper pseudo-reality that is still reinforced with reality TV, and now, to a much larger extent, with vloggers and "Instagram influencers"
And I'm not anti "sex work" by any means. I think it's just important to know what you're putting out there and how people adopt and internalize it. Cardi B for example. "Choke me daddy" shit. All of that is seen, heard and absorbed
If it's private consentual, fine. But I think it's different than people putting all their sexual baggage on Twitter. It's not like I'm making porn that thousands of incels jerk off to, there's a difference https://t.co/0q4FsZj9Ww

Traditionalism isn't just nostalgia, it's a return to a system of morality and order that has been ousted from society
The more we used postmodernist rationale to justify normalizing things that were just recently considered unthinkable the more we dug our own grave. And now we just slowly watch the house of cards crumble.
We're merely paying the consequences for the hubris of dumbing down and sexualizing pop culture you fucking greedy retards
Misogyny doesn't exist in a vacuum. If you don't think there have been shifts in sociology and culture that have ramped it up, especially pornography you're delusional. Everything in history has been a wave, cause and effect, ebb and flow
was Ted Bundy an incel? 🤔

https://t.co/rmR2PciUAV
Guys who literally choke and piss on girls calling them awful degrading things trying to take the high road with their navel gazing. Foh.
And it's not even "the bedroom" anymore it's weird rape fantasies in sex dungeons. Please, end this cognitive dissonance with sexuality. Porn stars are no different than actors
Somehow in Western society we've detached "the bedroom" from every other aspect of life almost as if that isn't directly feeding into the rest of culture. It is. People are sick.
Somehow sexual abuse is cool if you're paid to do it and she's into it? But those very same people with masochist fetishes are radical leftist hardliners. Very contradictory logic for contemporary feminism IMO. 🙄
there is so much contradictory weird Freudian shit going on with "Daddy" culture and intersectionalism. Pornography is almost inherently misogynistic and somehow we separate fetishes and taboo sexual activities from the rest of fodder for thinkpiece writers
The end goal all ties back into a sort of totalitarian indoctrination that squashes dissent with conformity. It's basically like intersectionalism is cucking your rights away. I dread the next implementation phase of the new world order as it relates to freedom of speech
I guarantee one of your favorite authors or artists in the last century did things far more "problematic" than today's media shitstorm culture but today we can't even frame discussions or pose questions in ways that might be seen as offensive
compared to the things artists and writers were doing in the 20th century outside of their work that they got off the hook or even lauded for, I am still incredibly perplexed how people who create art or write in this day and age are crucified for merely saying or thinking things

And my anger always shifts to disappointment and pathos
Especially when you can stand back far enough from it all to see how time and time again it is their own arrogance and vanity that undermines them
Seeing people not grow or learn from mistakes despite being successful or making strides in other aspects of their lives is such a massive disappointment
Not even seeing their bad karma unfold in real time brings any sense of grim satisfaction or closure bc ultimately you realize they're the same person they were when they fucked you up. There's just a hollow separateness in which you see someone walking into a wall ad infinitum
Or they just plug their ears and go LALALALALALALA while whatever guilt they still have slowly festers inside them
Social media allows people to forget and move on so easily. Redemption doesn't even exist anymore and they all just hop from one botched relationship to another
and so all the catharsis from the night before evaporates like nothing ever happened

A lotta people also have to consider that Buddhism is rough. Like there is a lot of dark shit, it's not just "namaste" and golden rule, it's a vehicle to the path of enlightenment, and that journey cannot always be a pleasant one because that's just the nature of existence
When cancel culture and media propaganda is no longer the status quo (which will likely not happen for as long as MSM exists) then I may consider saying things more palatable and optimistically righteous or whatever
And you know, considering how dark and vile so much of the media we consume is, (particularly stuff on Netflix or cinema) in a way I think I'm just holding up a warped mirror to society
Again, you have to see things in context with  the general canon of literature. A lot of literature employs devices meant to instill and provoke certain elements of the human condition, even uncomfortable ones. Please, grow a backbone and do not take all of my points literally
Having said that I will still totally dunk on people or tear them to shreds if they abuse power or have shitty takes or make the web deliberately more fractured and toxic. Maybe that's just the nihilist vigilante in me idk. And yeah, I know I can be a hypocrite, that's inevitable
However, my work is a sort of jumbled inconsistent contradictory pastiche of real and fictional elements, some of which I know reflect on me poorly, but that's kinda what I set out to do. You're meant to sift through the noise to find your own meaning or interpretation
I'd say I lean more towards criticizing culture, the state, socioeconomic trends and the media than I am an ideologue or political theorist. My specialty is literature and I also happen to be into politics and philosophy.
@ByYourLogic are there still hostages
If we can widen the range of discussion for our lively debate to occur in that's a pro in my book
I try to use humor to frame a lot of my more taboo opinions but I know for a fact a LOT of people don't get me or find me funny and I'm cool with that because that's the position of vulnerability you have to put yourself in to make a difference
I mean I hate cops. So there's that. I hate Israel. Tricky, uncomfortable topic. I'm anti-war, specifically neoconservative imperialism or whatever or subversive three-letter agency sabotage. But uhhh, i dunno, I think I generally have a clear conscience and consistent compass
I mean, I like Nick Mullen but a lot of people don't. 

I'm not really sure how I can frame my content lol.
You're perfectly free to disagree with me or call me a bigot but frankly I'm detached enough from my online persona for it to impact my day to day life. It's completely another thing if or as soon as my career enters the public sphere but idc my life is already in shambles
there are definitely a lot of shitty people with shady morals about but I still think the majority are just pretty normal people who are against mainstream bipartisanship and normie scum. I often due things to offend but primarily for the sake of widening a window of discussion
Even though I consider myself primarily a leftist anarchist I sometimes resonate more with certain alt-lite trolls than tankies you know what I mean
leftist twitter beef is such a joke lol. I have such a weak grasp on the political spectrum of most of the accounts I like. I follow a ton of people on here I disagree with significantly but I follow them because I think it's important to observe the gestalt of the discourse
really resonates with me for where I'm at in my artistic/literary path and the methods which I employ for expressing my ideas &amp; emotions

Americans love to talk though. About being right. About everything.
