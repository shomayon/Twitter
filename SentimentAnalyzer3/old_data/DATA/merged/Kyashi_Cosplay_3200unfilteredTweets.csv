My shoulders and hips (and one part of my leg) are really hurting today but I've forced myself to walk to the shops. 

Slow and steady. 🐢
@Wolfie_2000 Yeah that's the point. My account hasn't had anything different so I can't tell why I've been locked out.
@Wolfie_2000 When I go onto it it stops Mr saying my account is locked and I have to go through a bunch of security stuff. It doesn't give me a reason other than "possible breach of our guidelines"
I've been locked out of my Twitter account for the third time in as many months. As far as I can see, I'm not breaking any rules?

@StephanieJayneK Yeah just 😂 and that's hella exciting! And yeah since MCM my face looks awful and I want to cry
@StephanieJayneK The meeting was terrifying, both my boss and colleague aren't in today and they thought they had rescheduled the meeting. 
Some companies will take you on with training rather than the degree! Maybe look for that route?
And I'm having a detox from foundation and makeup is effort.

Although I don't think I can stay up 2-4am on a work day for E3 😅

@Mikkeltron I never played the first one. Not a fan of zombie type enemies. I'm a big wimp 😂

@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I fail to see how you think a choice is equal to killing the elderly. Involuntary euthanasia isn't a thing. That's just murder. But then the choice to be euthanised isn't there either so maybe you should think about that cause first?
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Wait I thought you said an unborn foetus was a person too? Isn't that three? Sacarsm.
Their lives have not begun yet, they are unable to live outside the womb. And once Ireland is able to provide that care without judgment and to a sufficient level, then maybe your point is valid
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Once again, we are not killing babies. 
And frankly, before they have been born, the mother's life should still be more important. 
The amount of kids in care is ludicrous, and the suicide rates in foster kids is high as hell.

@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews There are already over 7.6 billion people in the world. There are finite resources on this planet. Don't try defending your cause with overpopulation of the planet. 
Also, I don't think you have the correct statistics to back up that claim.
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Somehow I think all the kids in care, abused by their parents etc etc would beg to differ.
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews So women deserve for their lives to be ruined by a child they did not want, cannot care for, is a product of abuse/rape, severely disabled, cannot afford, risks the mother's wellbeing long term or short term? 
I think most women would prefer the choice. They don't have to take it
@_HarriRose 😘😘😘
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews We are going round in circles love. I would rather have the choice to terminate a pregnancy that I do not want, there are still rules in England with the option to abort. The moment you willingly put a unborn foetus before a living woman, you've condemned another life to misery.
@MadHatterJimmy Yeah I'm planning on a Corsair keyboard. And yeah I use my laptop screen when streaming. Again this screen is borrowed
@MadHatterJimmy Lol god no.
@MadHatterJimmy The headset was a present, the mouse is Grant's, I can't find mine 😢
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Whether it is likely or not those few women should be given the choice. And seeing as I live in England, where thankfully, abortion is legal, it really does not become an expectation. It's still a damn hard decision but give a woman a choice.
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Intestines are developed outside the body and twist in. Definitely not all in place by then. There's no use in an undeveloped lung. It's like saying uncooked chicken is still suitable to eat. And what about protection from an abusive family due to being born of rape/force?

@RuthMarieLand @Trish_Jones_ @BBCNews Two losses? I'm so sorry 💙 I'm glad you've been somewhere that does give you the option and care you need 💙
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews No one said about the delivery of an unborn baby... It would poison the mother if it wasn't removed.
And so the mother, the VICTIM, should have to suffer instead?
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I think you best read up a little more. Lungs and kidneys still need to develop through the entirety of the pregnancy. https://t.co/Wf2zVOopJM
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Contraception isn't 100% effective. Therefore a couple trying their best to avoid pregnancy could end up with an unwanted pregnancy. 
But you'll risk the well-being of a premature baby born at 23 weeks because it kicked? It doesn't have the organs to survive alone...
@RuthMarieLand @Trish_Jones_ @BBCNews I'm sorry you had to go through that. The right to a safe abortion should be available to every woman.
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Thanks for informing me on how a human is created... But frankly a foetus cannot survive outside a womb until around 25 weeks. That is no life. 

I suppose you're someone who believes contraception is wrong too?
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Yet women aren't all given help. You're not killing a baby... It's not alive until it is born, until then, it is a foetus. I fail to see how a child born from rape or into poverty wouldn't leave a 'trail of devestation' too?
Let women make their own choice about their bodies...
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews What about a mother who was raped, or living in poverty, who's life is at risk through not having an abortion?
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I'm not sure if you know the OP but she could have been at risk due to something wrong with the mother rather than the unborn. It happens so often. -_- since when did the rights of women men less than something that cannot survive on its own?
@miliszan Thank you sweet. I keep being relieved I'm not but sad I'm not 😂
@xmako_eyesx That's true. I probably would end up collapsing and without Grant to help me and notice when I'm going I would probably freak a bunch of people out! 😂
Tho when my mum asked me if I was going I kinda felt sad. I haven't missed MCM May in years.
But on the other hand, I wasn't even thinking about con until this week and I'm not as hyped for it as I once was.
It annoys me that I should have been able to afford MCM this weekend but fate had other plans and I have to focus on bills and stuff first. 😞

@inannamute @_JacobTheBear_ @AdamGCB This thread 👌 honestly I've represented a few companies through my cosplay in the past and either they never seemed to work out very professionally or I'd end up chasing for info from someone who's 'disappeared'
@_JacobTheBear_ @AdamGCB Ahh I guess that's true. Coming from a cosplay community into the more gaming focused streaming community etc it's difficult to gauge how it all goes down. I personally would still feel weird going to a company asking for a sponsor (but then I am new 😂)
@_JacobTheBear_ @AdamGCB I've been told to contact people about sponsorships but feel if I were to do that it comes across entitled and rude? If a company wants to sponsor a 'content creator', they'll find them on the radar and then decide themselves without prejudgements about their character. 
Imo tho.
Every day I find it more and more difficult to talk to those I care for. Not because I don't care, but because I'm tired, I'm drained, I'm stressed.

@marsbarbarbar Yup looks like it may be the only option for a while 😔
@Blackmask291081 Yeah I think I may too. Thank you 💙
@nettynunu27 Thank you sweet 💙 yeah I think I'll take a hiatus for a while. Though sadly I've definitely put on weight but I appreciate the compliment 💙😂
I really feel so distant from cosplay ATM.

I've gained a load of weight, I can't work on anything new, I'm too tired to try new cosplays, I hurt so much when I attend cons, I've become too nervy to speak to togs or other cosplayers.

What happened to the hobby I loved so much?

@ReiTheChocobutt I think you'd definitely know your own body better than the "medical professional" anon. 
And yeah it really does and I feel it's even worse when you don't have a name to the illness, like you do ATM, because it doesn't sound "real" enough to others sadly. :(
@ReiTheChocobutt They obviously cannot comment as they haven't even seen you to diagnose you either. Just because you can't see the illness or diagnose it right away  doesn't mean its not there.
@ReiTheChocobutt As someone who's just forced the doctor to diagnose me with Fibromyalgia as "back pain" wasn't describing my pain well enough and I'd gone through everything else...this anon is a dick. If really a med. prof. then they're one of the ones who ignore new findings too. Fuck them.

@SaintSpartan03 I need to really look into it because I don't feel I give enough and the rewards are really unimaginative. I'll give it a proper think over this month but I'm not sure with my service on it ATM
Really rethinking my Patreon... 

I don't think as the cosplayer I am right now I can provide good enough 'rewards' for my patrons. 
Maybe I should just focus on streaming and look into it again in the future.

@SaintSpartan03 They did a bunch of background things and it's been down most of the day. Meaning that the wait times this evening might be crazy long.
Might stream something else other than Fortnite tonight as they've been updating the game most of today but the wait times if it comes back up may be ludicrous.

Okay this Google Pixel 2 will take some getting used to but I love it already. Only thing I'm struggling with is there's no device photo gallery. It's just Google photos 🤔
I have a new phone. Can't wait to play with it. Only question now is whether to import all photos/apps/etc from my current phone to my new one or start from scratch and file photos etc more neatly
@superkalel5 Thank You!

@SaintSpartan03 Thanks man 💙 I've kinda felt like this since London MCM tbh. I didn't expect to still feel low almost 3 months later :/ Twitch has helped me feel a bit more human but still can't get over the original low y'know :/
It's literally making me want to cancel my patreon and kofi and twitch and not go to any cons. I literally feel like I'm at rock bottom. If I can't like my own stuff, why would anyone else...
My enthusiasm for cosplay has really gone out the window recently. Like I just looked at the overcoat for Gentiana and thought, "wow that needs to go in the bin..." I was so proud of it originally but now I'm just like Ergh...
@StephanieJayneK Woah what a Dick move. Hope you're okay sweet 💙 (if it's any consolation my nan said I ruined my body with my tattoo)
Merry Christmas everyone. Hope you've all had a good day 💙🎄💙

@LouJM_ Please don't. Cosplay photos need to stay cause they show how much you improve as a cosplayer and a person. I know what you're feeling but don't give up 💙

@louisejulie_ Will do sweet. Fucking sucks eh?
Feeling hella low and can't figure out why. Someone suggest something to cheer me up. Like asap.
@_MightyAvenger You'll be fine. Plus your airport is the easiest airport ever

Is it that hard to believe that chicks can like rock music?

To think my derp face has more reach and likes than my suggestive photo on Instagram is actually a joke.

@V3rmilion_N1nja Complete random. But more so when I'm bending down and touching it.
@nettynunu27 Do sombraaa
@V3rmilion_N1nja Yeah problem is it's not constant. So likelihood of it actually hurting while at drs is slim 🙄
@marsbarbarbar Hmm okay. Well if the pain continues past this weekend I'll go to the docs.
@marsbarbarbar For the docs I mean
@marsbarbarbar I'm not on any medication 😂 it's literally out of the blue. I don't want to go to the docs if it's just a migraine. That's a waste of time.
@marsbarbarbar True. But it's not like Twitter was the first thing I went to to find info...
@marsbarbarbar Thing is I've lost faith a bit due to my back. If it's something docs can see they'll fix, if they can't just painkillers that don't work. 😔
@marsbarbarbar True I know. But I don't know how much they can really do. I mean what you gunna do poke it. Yup. Your head hurts. Have painkillers 😂😂
@marsbarbarbar Haven't gone to them yet. Need to switch over really. Just haven't had the time yet.
@MadHatterJimmy Should prob get eyes tested but it's not in the right place for eye related headaches
