What I’m trying to say is, you are not alone. You’re not alone in mental illness, and you’re also not alone if you’re the type of person who can’t “forgive” yourself for that mental illness.
Even now, on some of my worst days, I’ll find myself doing things to make myself “snap out of it” like take freezing showers or drink so much coffee that my hands shake. Not at all healthy.
I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety; and my doctor suspects I have tinges of OCD as well. For a very long time I thought my symptoms were just unfixable character flaws; my family background is definitely a “suck it up and pull yourself up by your bootstraps” type.
@TheRotund You look cute af.
Absolutely plagued with nightmares last night. That usually only happens these days if I forget my SSRI, which I did not, but it still can happen. Never let anyone gaslight you into thinking that symptoms of your mental illness are signs of a weak character or some shit.

I’m a middle child, so I’m more interested in keeping the common peace with the other seven women I live with than dealing with her bullshit, but one day she’s going to get evicted and I’m going to laugh in her face.
Just to clarify, this is the one that I’m 90% certain is a low level drug dealer.
She’s also the one who complains that the rest of us have thrown away her stuff when really they’re just sitting at the bottom of said dish pile.
I love when my garbage housemate takes time to complain that I’m spending too long doing the dishes when they’ve been sitting in the sink for a damn week piling up.
