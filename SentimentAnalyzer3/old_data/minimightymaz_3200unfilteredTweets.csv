@PatriciaWalker5 @iamlewisdean i just feel so bad now. i just said it wrong. my depression has been for years cannot take medication i was on. as body rejecting it and other meds for some reason. just really struggling cos of health its more things all the time. cos of a blood disorder and rare diease.
@poppyculcher @iamlewisdean hope your ok poppy anything i can do eva. just let me know. xx
@iamlewisdean nite. really sorry again felt ive offended u. i not like that at all. im not well and proberley not making any sense. VERY SORRY TO YOU AND EVERYONE. ❤❤
@dellaseren @iamlewisdean ive had it in past but one was dodgy. other one i missed appoitments due to health and i got kicked off. which i understood but i told them i was ill before started. so not sure what will happen this time at hospital under 7 specailist so alot of appoitments 😂
@iamlewisdean @poppyculcher i meant. u dont think oh i have depression 24/7  but it is always always there. there no cure but u can get help. and after years i know i needed it and that i couldnt run anymore xx
@iamlewisdean god no not me. saw a program last nite a poor girl was getting bullied for yrs online and tried to take her own life because of all them things. it broke my heart. because they dont think ill just come off social media. xx

@iamlewisdean ive said to people we are stronger then we think because we still here. and im still here for daughter xx
@iamlewisdean im really not putting this rite.💔 i dont think im like this because of my depression i never mention it cos people dont get it. im like this cos of my health and anyone with or without depression it would mess u up and thats normal. be werid it i was ok. so it ok not be ok. ❤
@iamlewisdean life is hard for everyone. harder these days with social media. all the fakeness on t.v  celebs.people teens and adults feel the need to be to change themselfs and god start to hate themselfs when there amazin just the way they are
@MVanterpool @iamlewisdean wish i could x but with everything going on. i carnt see any xx
@iamlewisdean ive been helping a person on here who finding life hard. because if i can do one thing. i can help people anyone with any problem

@BarbaraLadmore no way. glad she gone and not saying lewis amazing but no way was he bullying her. sick of people using that word. he just got bit frustrated think he wanted an apology cos he had said sorry earlier and she didnt say it back.
