@thelovelybon3s I know exactly what you mean. I think the same. I've started to get braver but still feel embarrassed, but I tell myself stigma can only be broken if we speak out &amp; if someone has a problem with it they don't deserve to be in your life
@lt_2190 Don't stop because others say you should. It's your choice how you deal with your trauma &amp; abuse. If speaking out helps you &amp; could help others I say shout from the rooftops!
This is so damn true. I'm always finding that if I open up, people open up about their own struggles too. Almost always the other person is suffering too. Be kind to people, you don't know what battles they are fighting in secret. https://t.co/hWGmNt1HiN

@BipolarGrrl I literally know nothing about blogs, I'm probably doing it all wrong lol thanks for taking the time to read it x
@BipolarGrrl I'm trying so hard to fight insecurities but it's not easy I know 😔
I have 2 blogs, here are the links:

https://t.co/zk56Z3WuMY - My blog about trauma &amp; my experiences.

https://t.co/WjpWsOP4Fb - My blog about life with BPD.
@BipolarGrrl Haha bless you! It's understandable you'd be like that if you never had praise growing up. I know that I'm that way to a certain extent for the same reason. I think I maybe hope for praise in certain situations but don't expect it
@BipolarGrrl I have those thoughts too. I worry I'm crap at it, but I've decided if my blog can help even one person then I've achieved something good. I just want my shit experiences to be turned into a positive that helps others ya know?
@BipolarGrrl I think I look more for an acknowledgement of my hard work rather than praise. I don't know, it's confusing. I've confused myself over thinking it 🙈😂
@BipolarGrrl It's always the negative stuff that impacts and sticks with us 😭 and a 3 year old cannot be fat, that is just evil to tell a 3 year old that!
Life &amp; limitations when living with #bpd &amp; other mental illnesses described perfectly here by @BipolarGrrl https://t.co/rcG9uw1lT2
@BipolarGrrl Yes exactly! I couldn't find the words but you've described it perfectly! Trying to find a balance that works is virtually impossible!
@BipolarGrrl You could always start a blog as it's not pressurised. I started my blogs in August &amp; I've found it so therapeutic. I really hope others read them &amp; can be helped by my experiences
@BipolarGrrl Could be either for me too. BPD is a huge culprit I think though. I have zero self esteem from being told by everyone growing up that I was crap &amp; useless. I just feel weird or awkward if someone compliments or praises me now.
@BipolarGrrl I want to push myself but I know there's a very very thin line for me between healthy pushing &amp; being completely overwhelmed &amp; panicked &amp; withdrawing completely from whatever I tried to do. It's so frustrating! I need a purpose in life!
So an exciting opportunity is coming my way &amp; its got me thinking.
What would you want from a peer lead mental health community hub or group?
And also would you attend something like this?
Please comment with thoughts on this!

@HorriblyHuman I had this happen with my wife. I could see she was suffering from anxiety but she had no idea let alone a diagnosis. I talked to her about it &amp; gave her tips to be able to cope better with it &amp; then she felt able to see a doctor about it once she admitted she had a problem

Take a break if you need it.

Take medication if you need it. 

Stop and make sure…

@pigletish @SarahGarlits So beautifully written. I hope he sees this 😍
@pigletish @SarahGarlits Omg this is a thing?!?! 🤓
@AndrewJordan92 Sounds like you are doing great to me ☺️👌🏻
@AndrewJordan92 I guess if we lose it in a healthier way it's more likely to stay off. I've no idea what 250lbs or 180lbs translates as over here lol we do stones and pounds or kilograms. I've lost 6lb so far, started a month ago. Weigh in again tomorrow to see what my weekly weight is
@AndrewJordan92 I've been dieting recently so lost weight from that, just eating healthier you know? But this week in particular I'm finding it hard to eat anything at all. I just have zero motivation
Does anyone else just get so low and have so little motivation that they can't even find the energy to eat? I've barely eaten the last few days. I just can't be bothered to be honest.

@anxietyaloner @JamesConlon_ I used to feel exactly like this. I even came to accept it. I just didn't think I'd ever be able to tolerate being with another person. But then I found my wife, and all that changed. I wasn't looking for love, love found me. Don't give up, you don't know who is round the corner
@MotherMRuss @MattHancock This is disgusting! I'm so sorry you are going through this. As if being sexually assaulted isn't bad enough as it is. I'm so sick of men getting away with this crap time &amp; time again. I know it hasn't helped you, but I thank you for being brave enough to report him!
@KMSeattle I keep having to restart my twitter too 😔 I think the tag thing is to do with privacy settings though
@JamesConlon_ Thanks. Big hugs to you too x

@CrazyQdilla Self care for me is allowing myself to rest and do nothing if I need to and not beating myself up for it. Well, I'm still learning to do this but I'm getting much better. It's the not beating myself up part that's hard!
@ambientshy @CrazyQdilla I wish we had these in the UK!

Day 30 of #SelfCareTogether with @pigletish
Challenge is "relax"
I've been so glad that this was the challenge today because I desperately needed it after a very busy couple of weeks. I needed time to just rest physically &amp; mentally https://t.co/ZdMBoDYJTq
@magiibson No. I've had to sign things to say who I want to be told and what things they can say and what I don't want discussed
@PedroLanca1 Thank you
@PedroLanca1 I'm always here if you ever want to talk. My DM is always open. I hope therapy goes well today for you. Hang in there. You will get through this I promise!
@hannahblogsmh They don't understand how important a diagnosis is. When I was diagnosed with BPD it was such a huge relief. Everything about me suddenly made sense. It was validation. We need that!

@hannahblogsmh I hate this so much. I have BPD with "bipolar traits". Like what the hell am I supposed to do with that? Is it a thing or isn't it?! So infuriating and confusing! 🤯
RT @BPDManicBirdie: Time for a new poll. 

Do you believe your mental illness also comes with special "superpowers"? 

Please elaborate in…
@BPDManicBirdie Yes! The super heightened empathy power! It's a blessing and a curse!
@PedroLanca1 Is there anything I can do to help? I hate days like that. Everything feels so hopeless. But, think about times you've felt like this before... You made it through, and you will again. For me, on days like this in particular, distraction is essential
@PedroLanca1 It doesn't stop, ever. I just thought this was the perfect way to describe it &amp; had to share, so people like you know you're not alone in this x
"My brain feels like someone is scribbling all over its pages and it's hard to keep up". Another person with BPD said this to me. This sentence sums up my brain pretty well.
