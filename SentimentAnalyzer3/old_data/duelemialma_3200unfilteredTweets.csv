Hm? How would he like it? How would he face it? I can bet anything I’ve got he couldn’t handle it.
What if I were him &amp; he were me?
It’s been seven months now &amp; I feel very depressed &amp; a little angry like I want to scream, cry, bleed &amp; lash out on him. Just need him to understand.
The part of the song in Under Pressure when Freddie Mercury goes “LALALALALA!!” is actually really funny when it’s on the radio played in public places... people just working &amp; shopping then you hear “AAAAHHH!!” “LA LA LA LA!!” “Why can’t we just get along, get along...” 😅
At least it wasn’t raining this morning when on my way to work. So thank God for that. 😇

Today didn’t feel like November 1st, it really actually felt like June 1st.
It’s really not a walk in the park, I remember when I first started working there man I almost didn’t want to finish the first day... mainly nobody tells you anything, you have to figure out things on your own &amp; look after yourself cause nobody cares. &amp; the locker room is scary..
There’s a new employee that came into work in the afternoon &amp; I was trying to train her within the 25 so minutes of work I had left &amp; with that manager we got, recently there’s been other employees that quit fast, I don’t know if this one will stay &amp; doesn’t get scared &amp;🚪 🏃‍♀️
An adult at the store grabbed a whole bunch of mini Lunchables &amp; they weren’t even on sale, &amp; it made me almost tempted to get one too.
I love my new clothes, I’ve been enjoying everything &amp; im so grateful.
Well at least I got food now. 🙏
@Avrilsgirlfan Hi, aw 😕 I had nowhere to go for Halloween &amp; I was off from work. Hoping next year will be my year. 🙏
I’ll try my best to see what I can do about that though.
It’s a such a beautiful day again today, but I’m at work this time for another hour &amp; by the time I make it home I’m going to have to sacrifice enjoying the weather by the water cause I need to get groceries...😔 No dock for me today... &amp; tomorrow supposedly rain.
We weren’t even open for business yet &amp; that woman confirmed what the girl was talking about how she don’t want to stay stuck working here with such close minded selfish no class people...
A coworker told another who was talking to me “Oh why don’t you just be quiet!” “Stop talking!” &amp; that terrible woman caught the wrong person... because that girl can speak up she don’t take shit, &amp; I decided is best for me to walk away. Goes to show how people are in this place.

He has tattoos. Among them is one big one for his deceased mother. Another for one of his oldest deceased brothers.
I wish he will tell me someday about his two oldest brothers who are deceased.
Ordered pizza but they not only took over an hour but they wanted me to wait another half hour so I had to cancel &amp; not ended up not having a meal to eat... So uh... no friend &amp; no pizza today. 😞

Yesterday totally confirmed that. So does that honestly speaking mean he thinks about me? 
Why would he go to the exact place the day after we spoken?
It is because he thinks about me? Why else? Of all days &amp; stores, he goes shopping to the one I mention to him of... c’mon? 😶!!
I noticed a pattern, whenever I mention a store to him, the next day he goes shopping there! He comes home with bags from the exact store &amp; location I had mention to him when we last would speak... first I thought it was coincidence but this is now a few times he’s done this! 🧐
I heard his door slamming a few times, of course he slams his screen door so careless &amp; a loco &amp; I happen to only spot him back his Mitsubishi here to unload his shopping that lucky bastard, he got himself big case of Great Value bottled water &amp; a new TV or computer screen...🤔
He went to Walmart yesterday, the day after he has seen me &amp; I put in effort to converse with him to try to connect with my buddy, well I mean we live next door so we’re stuck seeing each other sooner or later. I told him I was going to try to go there, next day he did too! 🧐🤨
I am depressed. I just want peace &amp; reconciliation.
Can God blame me for feeling angry? 
Can anybody blame me for feeling angry? 
Anger is the rarest/last emotion I would ever feel. I’ve rarely ever have gotten to the point of being mad, but since this betrayal &amp; abandonment by my friend, I haven’t been myself in such a long time
The silence between us is deafening.
A year later no costume, rain, no friend. Dumb selfish old man sat outside by himself barefoot same chair same solitaire same cigarettes, the silence between us is deafening. I miss my buddy. He isn’t the same person I met 13 months ago, he isn’t the friend I had a year ago...💔
I remember a year ago today, I went to throw out garbage in my costume &amp; he was sitting outside, it was raining &amp; we talked &amp; I clearly remember kneeling down by our doors getting splashed by the rain when he offered to go in his car to talk...now a year later I’m so disconnected
I went out even yesterday to grab a few items to dress up for my costume but ended up returning everything quick, realizing &amp; accepting its just not going to happen for me esp since I’m off work tomorrow &amp; I’ve got nowhere else to go to dress up for.
I’m most definitely disappointed &amp; very sad I don’t have a reason to dress up tomorrow. For the past two years I did for work but now this year reality/life fell apart on me &amp; I can barely hang in there &amp; there goes the only day I can wear my Tripp pants in public...
Fuck the feelings, it’s my soul that got hurt &amp; that’s the absolute worst. Unbearable mental pain. Why did this have to happen between us for?...
I feel a void in my stomach. I don’t know what made it feel so like... unsettled.
I’m now at the water, the ocean is absolutely beautiful &amp; sparkling today thanks to the sun. It’s cold &amp; windy but it’s tolerable &amp; too nice to miss out.
God is good, I made it to the commute that gets me home. I was so concerned I was going to miss it &amp; have to haul a ride somehow.  How did I make it in a matter of about 10 minutes in a long distance drive, only the Lord made it possible.
I leave work in an hour! I love these shifts. Gimme all of them. 😊😇

Too much silence between us.
Too much distance between us.
Too much pain for me.
I miss my buddy. Why is it taking this long? I’m not asking for the world.
One year ago at this very time we were friends, he cared about me like nobody would believe, it was so sweet &amp; kind. I never even had to ask it wanted or expected, it was all him being a friend. We spent hours all night talking outside our doors... 7-11 was our fave spot to go to
The emptiness, loneliness, depression &amp; broken heart has consumed me. I feel guilty &amp; I blame myself for everything &amp; for him pushing me away &amp; not caring about me.
Why is there too much unrighteousness?
Why isn’t that enough? What is wrong?
I gave him space, I left him alone, I stopped going out to try to talk to him. I went m.i.a for weeks &amp; do you understand how extremely difficult that is to do esp living next door?! He’s my friend I miss him to death &amp; he lives next door &amp; I let him be! What else does he want?!
I can’t keep doing this. What is the point? Where is my light? When will it be my turn in life? Why is God silent when you need him most? What is going on? Why is this even happening? Why is this still happening? Why is it so hard for him to just T A L K to me? I miss him, damnit
I haven’t been myself these past six months, now it’s about to be November &amp; I feel so dead. I can’t go through the winter alone. I don’t want to, I can’t stand it, I despise thinking how I had to deal with this summer, it was so horrible &amp; wasteful. I feel badly depressed &amp; dead
Tried to find ways to stop the pain but ended up getting too late &amp; I feel so empty &amp; faded away... like forgotten &amp; as if I’m drowning &amp; nobody notices anything wrong.
Lost hope. 💔
Sadly it’s hard coming to the water nowadays after what happened in the restroom. I’m not going to spend too much time at once here, will have to come back later.
Wow my playlist was rockin this morning song after song! 🎸🥁🎤🎧🎼 Thanks for that, y’all. 😌

Plenty of people have my number but never reach out to me... 😔
My friend seriously broke my heart &amp; hurt my soul because he won’t speak to me. I can’t get through to him. It hurts &amp; I feel like giving up. I hate myself for it too. I just blame myself &amp; I am so sorry I feel that I ruined everything. I need him. I miss him. I still care. 💔😢
I saw him today, I was trying my best not to let him see me but when I went to take out my garbage he came out to sit with his phone &amp; I decided ok... fine just go along with it, dear Lord I miss him why won’t he communicate with me, I feel depressed &amp; hopeless. I waited too long
I miss my friend, Abba Father✝️ I’m only asking that he talks to me again. Not asking for favors, not asking for him to buy me anything or give me anything or even take me anywhere. I never even did to begin with, ever, all those times spent together was all his planning &amp; ideas.
I love the pajama pants I just bought, I needed a pair &amp; very thankful I found these cool ones! 🙏
I would never want to be a parent unfortunately because of how scary &amp; dangerous this world is especially nowadays to bring any children into this dark sick world. Personally not me. Sadly because I feel I’d be an awesome sweet mother but not while too mucb evil happening.
Little kids with bad behavior is so awful, of course the parents are to blame if you don’t raise them right they don’t know better, a little girl about 3 on a long line at the register said “get out of my way” when her mom told her “Let’s go, Alexa” No Alexa, you say “excuse me”!

Kinda had hope &amp; inspiration about Halloween but apparently wouldn’t get my order on time for Wednesday so I’m very sad it’s a no go for me this year... 😟
I couldn’t go out today at all due to the nor’easter, &amp; my so called “friend” next door doesn’t talk to me still &amp; breaks my heart. Not even that other neighbor who likes to claim we’re friends &amp; gives hugs &amp; kisses but being an actual friend she a stranger too, nothing but fakes
Just let me die already. Please.
The only person who talked to me at all today not only just texted me but yelled at me &amp; got pissed because I didn’t respond right away, it was only a half hour &amp; I didn’t speak to anybody nobody called nobody came over, I just got a pointless text that resulted in anger at me 😔
At least I’m still connected to his WiFi, right? Right? 🤷🏻‍♀️😇
Why do the bad selfish people get everything someone could need &amp; want happen for them? they get the luxury &amp; life seem to work out for them for? but the good humble people suffer &amp; get left out &amp; struggle? Dear God, why? What is this unrighteousness about? God, it’s my turn now!
He really went shopping I see as he’s been suddenly wearing all these new clothes everyday... he has no idea how lucky he is &amp; it hurts to see him have everything happen for him &amp; he is still this bitter selfish cold soulless ungrateful zombie..I don’t understand. I want justice!
I don’t want to reach out to him first cuz every single time I have these past months hasn’t been effective, it really didn’t help me or us at all it only pushed him away further unfortunately. It’s extremely difficult to keep distance but I wait on God’s plan, let go let God.🙏
First try on a tarot reading freaked me a little how accurate it felt &amp; was with everything mentioned... but it leaves me wondering why then is he not trying to reach out to me in any which way or form? I’m right here, dumb idiot! just call or knock or ring... he complicates it!

I’m hopeless. I can’t keep living hopeless.
My soul hurts. I so badly want to give up.
Heartbroken. Betrayed. Hurt. Remorseful. Sorry.
I’m both. I don’t know how I’m so Dean  here &amp; I’m most certainly Seth right there at the same time... https://t.co/wUhOMWwccL

I hope not, I don’t want to hear or see the S word... https://t.co/heTzfF9l41
Why did he do that? 🤔 He left me his store fliers &amp; junk mail in my mailbox yesterday but I just realized earlier tonight that they’re from last week? Why did he keep them &amp; decided only yesterday to give them to me? Why did he hold off on it? He didn’t do that before. 🤨🧐😕
Now I want camouflage pants... 😕
He got camouflage pants now too. He’s got all these new clothes suddenly... a bunch of new clothes, new mattress, new car. How is this happening for someone without a job?
2018 summed up for me: https://t.co/YqPbsInAKN
He kicked his bro out after months &amp; months of trying to get him to leave, &amp; one night he left &amp; he still had the nerve to talk shit about his bro to his bestie &amp; apparently they keep in touch cause his bro still comes over to pick up mail, so why is he not talking to me still?😔
He talks to his sister, who he absolutely in total seriousness said he’s done with her &amp; not speaking to her anymore. But now he is he went to her house, so he talks to his brother he talks to his sister, he talks to the neighbors &amp; everybody else, so why doesn’t he talk to me?💔
I just spared a stranger the horror of having to encounter the repulsive mess in the women’s restroom. Just use the men’s restroom here... unfortunately people here have no consideration or thought for others. &amp; no I’m not going home because the docks is my only hangout.
I can’t deal being in this world anymore. No humanity. No respect. I wish I can get out of here already.
I can’t even anybody that works out here so they don’t think it was me! So they don’t wonder why I went to the men’s restroom... dumb bitch I hope shit like that comes back to her cause that’s beyond disrespectful &amp; no class, no manners.
Whoever is the bitch who puked in the stalls &amp; didn’t use the toilet I hope that comes back to you!! Nothing more disgusting &amp; sickening then to need to use a restroom &amp; find puke everywhere! Worst thing ever. I had to use the men’s room. People are horrible &amp; disgusting.
I see it thankful for a clear view at home, the moon is so lovely. 💛🌕 https://t.co/TXZ3mvYPDE

Dear God, I just really hope J is my age. I can’t be bothered with men too young or too old because it just won’t work out, &amp; I learned that the hardest worst way with men too old, &amp; too young would just be like babysitting &amp; not worth the time either, that’s not good for neither
I think I should try to get to know J from work more... I’ve been feeling that. He seems loyal &amp; always been really nice to me. He has a unique laugh that I can imagine along with my laugh we’d be such a riot. ☺️
I wish somebody would reach out to me because I’m so broken &amp; lost. 💔🌌
Breakfast before work was pretty good, I think I’ll skip the scone next time though to be healthy &amp; just get something else better for me along with the meal.
Now all I ask for &amp; begging God for my friend to just simply TALK to me... that my friend simply just communicates with me... all I want at this point &amp; to have a couple minutes one on one in his car for genuine connection for reconciliation &amp; peace between us. That’s ALL! 💔😢☠️
I remember when he was telling me what happened he looked over at me &amp; (insert daydreamy emoji) well I miss that night so badly. I miss everything all our good times. I miss him to death. He initiated everything we did &amp; everything he’s done for me, I never asked for any of it.
I miss the night we went to get coffee &amp; he wore his camouflage/hunter pj pants &amp; he got us chocolate it was Reese’s with cookie pieces on the inside, I feel that there was something else we ate I can’t remember... &amp; he took me to see the home he used to live in that was haunted
I miss hanging out with my buddy.
I’m dying inside. My heart bleeds.
