Time to reflect, and it is also the time to #StepUp to do our job as citizens of this country. 

We can do better than this. Never take it for granted, this is not what we are.
I have high hopes for you Malaysians, I really do. We cannot have people keeping quiet and do nothing as we trail on the path of self destruction.
Don‚Äôt come back to me and say, ‚ÄúLook what have I done.‚Äù

We cannot turn back the clock and undo what has happened. The moment we shut our eyes, ears, mouth and especially your heart, you have already lost your conscience.
You may think this is a way to keep your constituents and voters happy, keeping you in power for the term.
It‚Äôs easy to destroy the country‚Äôs stability in a day, it takes years to rebuild what we have achieved.
And here we are arguing about the the ugly people in our society. I ashamed of you and so should you.

Xenophobia, pseudo nationalists, race supremacy, bigotry, hatred and violence.
I‚Äôm feeling very depressed looking at how low we can go with all these nonsense. We have families and kids in the streets without shelter, children with poor access to healthcare and education, parents struggling making ends meet.
I‚Äôve travelled to Thailand, Singapore and the US for the past five months speaking about the prospects of Malaysia‚Äôs future post elections. 

I was very positive with the reform agenda and the direction of the new administrations policies on economics, democracy and society.
What changed? The ugly attitudes and bad habits die hard. How fickle are we when faced with such racism, deeply entrenched in the society.

The ultra-nationalists have gone to the extent of harassing the minorities out in the public, taking videos, shaming them on social media.
Why are we keeping ourselves quiet and witnessing all these going on around us? 

We woke up on May 10th, aspiring a new dawn for the country, democratically voted üó≥ in the election and a peaceful transfer of power.
I teared up when I was visiting the African American Museum and the Holocaust, how cruel racism can bring to humanity. This is not normal, it is not right.
It was really cold, eerie and dark when I reached home after being away for 6 weeks. I‚Äôve expected that I will feel very depressed back home, like what @lim_yi_wei said prior to our flight back with all the other fellows.
I‚Äôve seen how ultra nationalists and racism in the US, I expect much better situation back home. No, you‚Äôve disappointed me over and over again my dear Malaysians.
#Thread I don‚Äôt expect much from Malaysians, you can be better than this. I knew that this sort of ugly heads of ultra-nationalists and race supremacists will pop out again.
Sejuk, sunyi dan sepi, inilah yang saya rasai sekembalinya di Malaysia. Saya faham dan saya redha. Mungkin saya harus membuat pertimbangan seterusnya.

What would you like to know more?
Enough is enough in the new era in a post election Malaysia. No more politicians seeking endorsements and support to take up positions in sports associations. Put the right person for the job to help our athletes, not for personal gain.
Elected representatives are encouraged to lend their support, both morally and financially to help sports associations to raise funds, not coveting for its positions.

We‚Äôve seen and experienced the damage done with heavy politics in sports, we have to move forward.
What do you think? In the previous administration for the past few decades, the sports industry was heavily ‚Äòpoliticised‚Äô with the entry of politicians leading the associations.

@klubbkiddkl Yup, consequences of her mother‚Äôs actions. That part, we have to call it out. 

Let‚Äôs have coffee someday!
@klubbkiddkl Where do the buck stop anyway? 

Everyone in the media has a role to play, in this case, it affects everyone. It doesn‚Äôt paint media as the boogeyman in any way. 

Parents‚Äô role as the first barrier is one, but we do need to be mindful too. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Good day.
@klubbkiddkl Yup, it is important to educate the people about the risks of exposing their children in that way. Conversations like this have to continue, parents ought too.
@klubbkiddkl It‚Äôs good that we have this conversation, and it is not wrong to report story like this and I disagree that my statement was misguided, possibly I did make it clear to you. Sorry for that.

In my opinion, blur the photo or use another generic image instead.
@klubbkiddkl My take on this. There‚Äôs another way to present this. One can attribute the story or comment pieces by using a generic photo instead the unblurred photo of the child mentioned.
@klubbkiddkl I beg to disagree. Her mother exposed her, there‚Äôs no need for media to expose her further on the larger platform. 

Irresponsible for her mother to do so, it doesn‚Äôt make it right for the press too. We have to do our part too.
I don‚Äôt get this, why do the press need to show the face of a young child and expose her to violent cyber attacks in that way? Where is the ethical practice in journalism to protect the minors? https://t.co/CzjtF1e3fU

#acyplPFP #ProFellows The decentralisation of education autonomy to the state is an option, and also a possible choice to reduce the financial burden from the federal and empowering the state with an autonomy in the framework of education policies.

@ACYPL @yseali
#acyplPFP #ProFellows Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned: It had to be a bottom up collaborative effort with the schools, teachers, parents, students, legislators and stakeholders.
#acyplPFP #ProFellows ‚ÄòThe Commonwealth has a duty to provide education for all its children, rich and poor at the public level.‚Äô

There was a great sense of public response towards deteriorating education policies at that time, growing divide of education quality of schools.
#acyplPFP #ProFellows ‚ÄòEducation is the well spring of the way of life‚Äô 

Massachusetts strives to be the model  of education system, pushing for a higher quality of education.

1993 Massachusetts Education Reform Act, introduced as a ‚Äòsweeping act‚Äô of educational reforms.
#acyplPFP #ProFellows 90 percent of the funding comes from the state while the federal funds 10 percent for the public schools. A stark difference is that the state and local stakeholders have vast autonomy in determining the policy for schools.
#acyplPFP #ProFellows Education has a very important place among Malaysians, the same too for many Americans.

@miraazmin Thank you Mira!
It has been a blessed year for me and although I faced some challenges dealing with depression, many friends and family reached out to help.

Blessed with God‚Äôs grace.

This was 2012 when I lost much of my weight during my stint in Singapore. I should pin this up as a reminder to myself to keep fit. Here we go! https://t.co/3UHHK9nuWD
I'm alarmed at how Facebook removed two of our news articles over an alleged copyright infringement when these stories were reported from statements posted on the page. Is this how media/press getting attacked by some groups of people with influence? This is worrying.

Tidak kira apa darjat dan kedudukan seseorang itu, pada ketika kita menemui ajal dan dikuburkan, akhirnya menjadi abu juga. Yang Maha Esa sentiasa mengetahui segala tindak tanduk kita di duniawi.
