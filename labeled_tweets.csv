-3,"13.) recalling information in a coherent way is difficult so in the workplace, people are often confused to what i'm talking about. i'm not very good at making sales because of this."
2,"13.) writing essays has become increasingly difficult, but my strengths have flipped from english and history to math and science since being diagnosed."
-3,13.) my first semester was extremely difficult. i couldn't remember anything and i was constantly forgetting to do assignments so i made pretty bad grades.
-8,13.) schizophrenia in school/work is hard to deal with. the cognitive symptoms really take a toll. it was really hard for me in highschool and without my friend helping remember dates i probably would be making really bad grades in rn in college.

-4,"12.) coping mechanisms! i cope by usually distracting myself 24/7. by creating stimuli, i can avoid the ones my brain creates. i usually have to have background noise as much as possible to keep myself occupied so i don't hallucinate. i sleep with headphones in and my lights on."

-6,"11.) we're also ""weird"", we say things differently, we act differently, we experience things differently. people will call the cops on us during psychotic episodes. it's hard to be open about it."
-7,11.) telling employers that you have schizophrenia when applying for a job usually doesn't end well. people are afraid of us and they'll do anything to avoid us.
-7,"11.) because schizophrenia is so stigmatized, it's hard not to be thrown into a mental institution. i've resisted it twice. the thought of being put in a hospital is terrifying to me. i'm afraid to be honest to any medical professional because of how easy it is to be thrown in 1"
-3,"10.) i have only been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia and most people with schizophrenia have depression and anxiety as well. it's not uncommon to have psychotic depression or psychotic BPD! psycosis goes hand and hand with lots mental illnesses"
-4,9.) schizophrenic representation in the media is usually fear mongering horror characters. or villains. we need positive role models for people with schizophrenia! i guarantee you that most of us need it to remind ourselves that we aren't the monsters that we think we are.

-6,"7.) we don't deserve to be feared, we are just like you! if anything, we're more likely to hurt ourselves rather than anyone else. if someone you know tells you they have schizophrenia, accept them, and know that they trust you enough to know."
-3,"7.) some of us hear voices that tell us to hurt people, but those people deserve respect too! i'm so scared of hurting my friends bc of the stigma it's unreal. i have so many nightmares where i kill my friends and i wake up afraid and in tears."
-2,7.) even a lot of people in the mental health field think we're dangerous! i told my therapist that i heard voices and she immediately tried to put me in a mental institution. we are not inherently more dangerous than any other person.
-4,7.) stigma. everyone and their mom knows the stigma surrounding schizophrenia. people think we're crazy unfeeling monsters who follow what the voices tell us. people think we're murderers or horrible people due to horror movies portraying us.

-9,"6.) i totally read the 6th prompt wrong but that's ironically a perfect segway to explaining cognitive symptoms! these include slow thinking, difficulty understanding, poor concentration and memory, and difficulty!"
0,6.) positive symptoms are usually treatable by antipsychotics! but negative symptoms require therapy and a lot of practice.
0,"6.) we also experience echolalia which is the repetitive behavior of spoken words. basically sometimes i just say the same thing over and over again! sorry if it's annoying, but it's completely involuntary!"
-2,6.) people with schizophrenia often sit or walk in different ways. i usually sit in positions that many people say is weird or funny but feel natural to me. these movements maybe be repetitive or restless but they are all involuntary.
-6,"6.) often times, people with schizophrenia just stop all together. i do this often. i sit and stare at something and nothing is going on in my brain. it's like dissociation but i can't move or talk and i'm often in a weird position. this is called catanoia."
-3,"6.) positive symptoms! these include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech/thinking, disorganized behavior, catatonic movement and behaviors. since i've already talked abt hallucinations, delusions, and speech, i'll talk about the other ones!"

-1,@GriizzlyB 2. First one is too busy
-2,@inannamute @_JacobTheBear_ @AdamGCB This thread _??? honestly I've represented a few companies through my cosplay in the past and either they never seemed to work out very professionally or I'd end up chasing for info from someone who's 'disappeared'
-1,@_JacobTheBear_ @AdamGCB Ahh I guess that's true. Coming from a cosplay community into the more gaming focused streaming community etc it's difficult to gauge how it all goes down. I personally would still feel weird going to a company asking for a sponsor (but then I am new _???)
0,"@_JacobTheBear_ @AdamGCB I've been told to contact people about sponsorships but feel if I were to do that it comes across entitled and rude? If a company wants to sponsor a 'content creator', they'll find them on the radar and then decide themselves without prejudgements about their character. 
Imo tho."
